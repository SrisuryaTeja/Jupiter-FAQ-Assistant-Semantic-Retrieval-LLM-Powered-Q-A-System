  "I opened jupiter account on 9th May 2022 today completed its first year.I would like to share this one year experience of using Jupiter. The main reason i opened jupiter was that my debit card from bank of india was getting delayed alot,one day suddenly i saw an ad and i got interested then i opened jupiter account. After opening the Jupiter account, I see that it is much better than my BOI account, better rewards, no branch visit , onboarding process was smooth and quick. Early on I used Jupiter for transactions, and to be honest I used it more for Jewel and even then I didn\u2019t have much money, not more than 4-5 thousand. Features Then vs Now: Then: I remember when i opened jupiter there was - Delay in balance update No Super Pots No Investment ( Mutual fund,FD,Gold) No Bill Payments No Mobile Number Change option No Tax Statement No Habits No cheque book No Nach payments No international transfer Only a typical savings and salary account. Now- Almost everything present and more on the way\u200b Things i use in Jupiter - Savings account for savings, upi transaction, POTS for small targets and use FDs as well. Jupiter UPI and card for 1% reward, i had auto payments through debit card. Electricity bill payments. Things i don\u2019t use in Jupiter - Mutual fund: as i already have a demat account in Groww thats why I don\u2019t use jupiter. Digital Gold: I don\u2019t like digital gold as with every buy 3% gst, sometimes prices are different from actual price and much more. Prepaid recharge: Actually i prefer credit card for most of recharge as I recharge the mobiles of my neighbors, friends and many others.So if I do all the recharges through bank then bank balance will be low and if I do it through credit card I get reward point and that moment the money is not leaving from my bank.I also had Jiopos lite and i top up it through credit card. Cons- The annual charges on debit card. When i opened jupiter they said it\u2019ll be free forever but now it is not. Although I don\u2019t have any problem with charges. Overall my experience with jupiter is great. I love jupiter and i am not going anywhere. Everyone share his/her experience, we all are listening",
  "Today (19/11/22) at 10:01 PM i created a super pot in jupiter , it showing processing from 15 mint and still on , even not showing in total net worth and amount is 50k so how many time it will take ?

  "It would be great to have some kind of quick access to 2-3 pots of my choice either on the home screen or on the pots page. The way I use pots is that I deposit money very frequently into some of them but the issue is that the pots I deposit into are buried deep into \u201cView all\u201d list. It gets mentally exhausting to have to go through a total of 3 clicks, the added cognitive load and distractions along the way to just add 200Rs to a pot. It would make my life a lot easier if I had access to some of my pots that I could either favorite or pin, either in the home screen or at the pots page to help with this. Another idea could also be widgets in iOS to allow for quick access to the pots of our choice. Or even the long press on an icon. Some kind of quick access is all I\u2019m asking for. What if Jupiter just gave different parts of the app quick access to the user based on their personal needs and niche usages. Make them all quick-accessible in some way. For me it\u2019s pots for someone else it could be gold. Who knows. All in all I think Jupiter has reached a mature stage in design and it\u2019s time to focus on some nifty experience uplifting features that truly make a user go \u201caha\u201d. Missing that honestly for the last year or so",

  "So about two months ago, I changed my mobile number through the Jupiter Bank app. The number changed successfully and the UPI ID began reflecting my new number. However, UPI transactions, both incoming and outgoing, started failing. I contacted support, they asked for 48 hours, then got in touch and asked for details I had already given them in writing. I had to do this whole charade at least 10 times in the intervening period. Every time i had to start explaining from scratch, none of the support people bothered to read the original complaint. Then they asked me for screenshots. Which their app does not allow. So they asked me to take a video of the screen from another phone. Which is dumb, considering I gave them exact issue details and the exact error message. But I did it anyway. After that, over the next few weeks, they asked me to do several things such as logout and login, delete app cache and data, uninstall and reinstall app, and practically everything else, and they asked me to take the stupid videos from another phone every time. Because they didn\u2019t trust my reading skills, perhaps. I did every freaking thing they said, NOTHING worked. As of today, I can login to my bank, my UPI ID is visible, but I cannot add any accounts. If I try to link my Jupiter / Federal Bank, it just says \u201cPartner server error\u201d in a purple box. If I try to add other bank accounts, it reaches the last stage and then says \u201cThere was an issue with this transaction\u201d in a gray box. They asked me for videos of this too, and I sent that as well. Now for the past two weeks, they just keep telling me they\u2019re \u201cescalating\u201d the issue with all the \u201cstakeholders\u201d. Nothing else. It has been two months with zero progress. Mind, every time i get in touch, they ask me to tell them what the issue is again, and they ask for videos of the errors again. The absolute dumbest part about this whole mess is that my Jupiter / Federal account is fully functional for UPI on GPay, PayTM and Samsung Pay. Their own app isn\u2019t accepting their own account, or any other account for UPI or spend tracking. No less, the fact that i can\u2019t even try reverting back to my old number, because they only allow you to change mobile numbers once in a year. For the past week, all i get in reply is the \u201cescalating\u201d nonsense. I have given up hope, and am killing my jupiter account. They\u2019ve probably escalated this to god himself by now, with no resolution in sight. A word of advice. Jupiter is buggy garbage. Skip it. Feedback to Jupiter: This is not how you run a bank. The mobile number change limitation is stupid. If you\u2019re going to ask for screenshots and videos every time i put in a complaint, remove the idiotic screenshot restriction from the app. Your chat support is buggy garbage too. The longer a conversation goes on, the more the dumb thing lags. At this point, a word i type in chat takes about ten seconds to show up on the screen. I think you\u2019re doing this intentionally to dissuade people from using chat support. Bye bye",

Cards1080\u00d71080 112 KB While the idea of a redesigned app has always been on the cards, the team started working on it in November 2023. 6 months and 600 screens later, we\u2019re ready to go live with a Jupiter that\u2019s bolder, more confident, and true to our mission of improving the financial wellness for millions of people. Introducing Jupiter 2.0 Home1920\u00d71116 73.9 KB payments1920\u00d71128 108 KB Money tab1920\u00d71136 70.7 KB Investments1920\u00d71126 72.9 KB After countless iterations, mini fixes, and some mighty overhauls, here\u2019s a look at everything\u2019s that changed. The interface is smoother and faster, illustrations are bolder, typography is modern & unique, and key numbers are in the spotlight. But there\u2019s more to come, so keep an eye on your Jupiter app. Ok Jupiter, show me the new colour palette To give you a picture, these are the colours we\u2019ll mostly be known for image1334\u00d71314 63 KB Let\u2019s break it done, shade by shade. The stark white has been paired with a warm beige. This is a easier on the eyes, even if you\u2019re looking at your screen in maximum brightness. We also introduced teal, light green, yellow ochre, and darker greys in our palette. These act as pops of colour, without being overwhelming. The iconic spacefire orange still remains, but in accents and highlights. While the Jupiter app you knew and loved was bright and playful with a unique space them, the Jupiter we\u2019ve now created is modern, confident, and focused completely on tools for your financial wellness. But why did we redesign the app? A consistent and seamless user experience: As you move from one screen to another, across Pots, investments, loans, or credit card \u2013 the app now feels like parts of a whole rather than disconnected parts. Trust & transparency: The new app brings key numbers, data, and insights at the forefront of your experience. This is to encourage a transparent relationship with your money.

  "I had a Pot named \u201cEMI\u201d of tenure 30 days. Everything was fine but on 18th February I added \u20b9500 to it. The amount gets deducted but it was not updated in the pots. Generally, it takes 24 hrs to update the pots balance, so i thought it will get updated. Now, After 4 days I saw that the balance was not updated yet. So, I added \u20b9500 more on 22nd February to check if that might update it. Now, Here\u2019s the issue, the amount that I have added on 22nd gets updated but the amount on 18th February is still missing. I contacted the support via app and they said that they will resolve the query and balance will be credited by 27th February. Now, on 27th February they closed the ticket and marked it as resolved but the amount was not credited. I had provided them with statements screenshot in that ticket number and now that resolved query itself is missing from the application help section. So, I mailed them stating the whole issue and with pictures of the issue. At this point the balance is updated in cashflow section but not in pots section. After a very long discussion over call, they said they will escalate the problem but can not tell me when the issue will be resolved and they will keep it window open but on the application they mentioned that they will contact me with a follow up in 3 working days but they are yet to contact me which I think they won\u2019t cause their customer support said that he can\u2019t tell me when the issue will be resolved. The amount should be \u20b93200 instead of \u20b92700 Ticket Number : 3056459 photo_2024-03-01_20-30-12720\u00d71280 148 KB photo_2024-03-01_20-30-17720\u00d71280 141 KB Explanation of Screenshots: the first screenshot shows the correct amount of \u20b93200 that is shown when you click \u201cView Pots\u201d in \u201cSaved\u201d section but the moment you click the pot to break it. It will show \u20b92700 . The money is still missing and Support is not helping at all. Moral of the Story: Do not invest in pots no matter how good you think the concept. It might happen to you too with much more amount. FYI: The issue is now resolved. 12 days to resolve it. 18 Feb 2024 - 2 March 2024",

  "Jupiter recently announced so-called Switch in credit card with much hullabaloo. At the same time, in collusion with Federal Bank, they quietly started a bait and switch scam. See Bait-and-switch - Wikipedia At the time of opening the savings account, it was told to be a zero balance account. There was no account closure charges if done within 14 days, or after 6 months. Now Federal Bank has sent out an email saying the zero balance will be removed, and moreover, there is no option to close the account without paying service charge! It has been 10 days since that mail from Federal Bank, but no communication from Jupiter clearly showing they are complicit in this scam. I understand the company is under pressure to start raking in the moolah to show the numbers to the investors, but taking this route of scamming customers cannot be accepted. Hence, please restore the original terms and conditions immediately, or provide an option to close the account without charges",

  "A bit about my Jupiter usage I started using Jupiter a year and a half ago. The sole reason I signed up for Jupiter was Pots. I was already keeping money aside for different purposes; Jupiter Pots gave convenient tooling for what I was doing. Jupiter Pots impressions Pots were great when I started. I liked them so much that I wrote a blog post praising them. While the rest of Jupiter has continued to improve and evolve, the Pots feature has stagnated mostly. There have been some changes, but they fall short of being good. For example, there is a Super Pots feature that lets you create fixed deposits using Pots. But on maturity, super pots will self-destruct, and the money will move to your saving account. That means Jupiter will put you at the risk of accidentally spending saved-up money on something unrelated! To me, that looks like a lazy implementation that doesn\u2019t stop to consider why the customer created a pot in the first place. Then they introduced Habits, which are essentially recurring deposits. Habits are buggy too; they move money from your saving account a day or two in advance. Reporting this issue to Jupiter hasn\u2019t really accomplished anything. But maybe that isn\u2019t surprising, given they don\u2019t even support updating communication address of bank accounts. (Not allowing address updates is a KYC norms violation, one would think?) Back to Pots being unloved. Even basic things like modifying pot names, rearranging pots in the UI, etc are not done even after so many months. Tells you how much they cares about Pots. Looking into the future The thing with convenience is that we are impressed by simple convenience initially. But over time, we take things for granted, and our needs evolve. We want more convenience. We expect our tools to do more for us. Same for me with Pots. I was able to overlook their flaws before, but now they are glaring. The Jupiter team not investing in Pots is understandable at the same time. Jupiter is a startup. Possibly a small team executing at their capacity to make their company a success by building features that people want to use. I am not surprised that no one outside a small niche cares about Pots. If Pots aren\u2019t bringing them customers or usage, calling Pots a failed experiment and exploring other ideas is the prudent thing to do for Jupiter, the startup. If Jupiter won\u2019t continue to be relevant for my needs, I suppose I should take care of them on my own. I already track my mutual fund savings using a spreadsheet. Making a similar tracker for bank account will be straightforward. Say, I close my Jupiter account and move all Pots to a tracker of my own. My primary bank provides auto-sweep fixed deposits, which means the money I hold as short term savings will earn a higher interest than the 3% Jupiter pays me. On top of all this, I\u2019ll be able to tweak the tooling as/when necessary. Such a flexibility is seldom available in a pre-packaged product. Looks like this is the end-of-the-road for Jupiter-and-me. Finally, Thank You to the Jupiter team for making Pots in the first place. Your product helped me see the convenience of separately labelled short-term savings. I may sever all my ties with Jupiter, but you have changed my life for the better. Thank you for that",

  "Hey there I have some queries and 2 suggestions for Jupiter. Some questions: Where I can find all my failed transactions or all transactions including failed ones?

And here are some suggestions: Add option to check the total balance including the fund blocked for IPO or Retail Direct through UPI ASBA. Currently it only shows the Effective Balance (The balance I can spend). Show the amount in the foreign currency too for international transactions in transaction details. Currently it only shows the amount in INR. But you may wonder why would someone need it!

So, if I as a consumer can\u2019t have access to my money or have issue in making transaction, I feel annoyed. I don\u2019t expect others to be forgiving with us. We have taken this concisous call that any product release has to meet basic quality checks in terms of security, reliability and usability. Else, we won\u2019t release. Few of community users already bashed us couple of times for facing bugs in live product. so we have become more cautious post that feedback and won\u2019t release any product which doesn\u2019t pass our quality checks. We are ok to face heat for delays but not ok for facing heat for quality issues. Hope you would appreciate the same. Also, pls have basic trust that we are more keen to scale and push products faster as it benefits Jupiter",

  "I am warning to all Jupiter members who have a fixed deposit in jupiter(federal bank). Specially who are thinking of a secure credit card with fd through jupiter. Now, the matter is- I booked a fd of 30K in May 2023 in jupiter. At that time i only have idfc wow card so i thought to take a credit card against my deposit in federal bank as it will boost my credit score. So recently due to hospitalization of my grandmother we are facing some financial problems so i have to close my card so i proceed to close card, cleared all due, raised request to close the card and card closed today. Then i tried to break my deposit through jupiter but it\u2019s failed. Then 1st i contacted Federal Bank team as i used federal bank Signet Credit card so i called them and they said you have to cantact jupiter team but again i tried to convince the same person that i took card from federal bank, they marked lien so what is the role of Jupiter here ? They said no you have to contact jupiter team. Then i contacted jupiter team, explained all things then jupiter csa also agreed with me that if you used egde visa or egde rupay card then it\u2019s our matter but as it\u2019s federal bank card so it\u2019s lien marked by their end. Then i again contacted Federal Bank and explained all things happening they verified all details and they clearly said i can see your fd lien marked by jupiter team and mentioned reason is \u2018NA\u2019. Now i need help. I am not gonna use customer care number they will tell the same for sure or not gonna use help section. I am gonna visit federal bank branch Monday if the problem still exists. If the problem solved by jupiter team in mean time then no problem i am good. And if still exists then no option left rather than RBI ombudsman. And i have all the required call recordings of both side. If any jupiter member thinking the same that to get a secured card of federal bank using deposit booked through jupiter ( i think I\u2019ve seen some one who asking if it\u2019s possible to get federal bank secured card using jupiter fd earlier) please don\u2019t do it",

  "THE IDEA: The idea is to add a feature to the JUPITER app that allows users to link multiple bank accounts from different phone numbers to their JUPITER account, particularly for users in India who frequently use dual SIM mobile phones. THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES: Currently, users who have multiple bank accounts linked to different phone numbers face difficulties in managing their finances through a single app. With this feature, users can add multiple bank accounts to their JUPITER account regardless of the phone number associated with each account, making it easier to track their finances. HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT IT SOLVING RIGHT NOW: By implementing this feature, JUPITER app can offer a more comprehensive and user-friendly financial tracking solution to its customers. This feature is expected to increase the transactions made through the JUPITER app as users will have the convenience of managing multiple bank accounts from a single app, leading to a more seamless user experience",

  "P2P, or peer-to-peer, in the context of mobile banking refers to the capability of mobile banking apps to facilitate direct transactions between individuals without the need for intermediaries such as traditional banks. P2P mobile banking allows users to send and receive money directly from their mobile devices, usually using a linked bank account or mobile wallet. P2P mobile banking offers several benefits, such as the convenience of sending money instantly without the need for physical cash or checks. It is often used for activities like splitting bills, paying back friends or family, or making purchases from individuals. However, it\u2019s important to note that P2P mobile banking platforms may charge fees or impose limits on transaction amounts, so users should be aware of any associated costs before using these services. Here\u2019s how P2P mobile banking typically works: *Registration and Verification *Linking Bank Accounts *Initiating P2P Transactions *Authentication and Security *Transaction Processing *Confirmation While P2P banking offers convenience and ease of use, there are some security issues that users should be aware of",

  "Well we keep hearing this every once in a while about the autodebits that happened . The root cause generally here is the dark patterns in payments. I faced it with big players like Amazon. The auto debit feels like you taking money from your parents wallet without informing or telling them.(loss of trust) Recently on a payment platform I faced an error of payment on my Edge card. It was because my card was not allowing to set up Auto-Pay. Initially I was not happy with the payment experience but I shifted to Jupiter debit card and the payment went through but I got notified on SMS as well as on the app about a setup of autopay. This notification on my app literally made me aware about the dark pattern I just went through. And Jupiter also give me a direction how to tackle or manage this autopay set up in the app. I hope Jupiter notifies me a week before renewal so that I can then decide if I want to continue with the payment or not. Thanks for building this feature and proactively tackling the dark patterns",

  "The Indian Premier League (IPL) was first introduced in 2008, which means that it is now 16 years old. In that time, the league has grown from strength to strength, attracting some of the biggest names in cricket and establishing itself as one of the most lucrative and popular leagues in the world. With a format that combines sport and entertainment, the IPL has captured the imaginations of millions of fans across the globe and helped to popularize the sport of cricket even further. From thrilling matches to star-studded lineups, the IPL has something for everyone, and its popularity shows no signs of slowing down any time soon. While the Indian Premier League (IPL) is primarily a sporting event, it has also become an important platform for fintech companies to showcase their products and services. With millions of fans tuning in to watch the matches, the IPL offers a unique opportunity for fintech companies to reach a massive audience and increase their brand visibility. Several fintech companies have already partnered with IPL teams and the league itself to promote their services. For example, Paytm, one of India\u2019s leading digital payment platforms, has been a title sponsor of the IPL in the past and has also partnered with various IPL teams to offer exclusive discounts and cashback offers to fans. Similarly, Dream11, a fantasy sports platform, has become an official partner of the IPL and has seen tremendous growth in its user base during the league. Fintech has a significant presence in the IPL. In the 2022 edition of the tournament, 29 start-ups joined the 10 IPL teams, with fintech companies being the top contributors, representing 34.5% of all participating start-ups. While the number of start-ups participating in the IPL has decreased to 19 in 2023 from 29 last year, fintech start-ups continue to lead the way in terms of sponsorship with 31.6% (Source: Inc42). Just like in the previous year, fintech companies are taking advantage of IPL\u2019s massive audience to promote their products and services. Overall, the IPL has become an important platform for fintech companies to tap into the huge Indian market and offer their innovative solutions to millions of cricket fans across the country. As the league continues to grow in popularity, we can expect to see more and more fintech companies leveraging the power of the IPL to reach new customers and expand their businesses (Hope the decrease in this year\u2019s sponsorship is only a short-term phenomenon). 2022 report:  2023 Article:  The 16th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 began on March 31, 2023, and will conclude on May 28, 2023. It seems like the only entity that isn\u2019t paying attention to the IPL carnival is Team Jupiter . Whether you browse Flipkart, MobiKwik, or any other app, you\u2019ll come across some form of IPL-related promotions, rebranding, prediction contests, and offers. However, there\u2019s been no such news or activity on the Jupiter App or in the community forum. Is there, not a single cricket enthusiast working at Jupiter?  Is the cost of sponsorship a significant hindrance? (I am not aware of the exact cost of Jersey sponsorships, although I know that a 10-second ad during the IPL costs millions). Are there any future sponsorship plans for Jupiter, such as sponsoring the Royal Challengers Bangalore team? Whenever I see the orange cap during IPL, I instantly associate it with Jupiter due to its distinctive colour. It\u2019s worth considering the value that IPL sponsorship can bring to a company. With a vast viewership and audience engagement, IPL sponsorship can be a great way to increase brand awareness and reach out to potential customers. Perhaps it\u2019s time for Jupiter to explore the possibilities of IPL sponsorship and capitalize on the potential benefits it can bring. Which is your favourite IPL team? Chennai Super Kings (CSK) Delhi Capitals (DC) Gujarat Titans (GT) Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) Mumbai Indians (MI) Punjab Kings (PBKS) Rajasthan Royals (RR) Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) 20 voters Results",

And the app also has Multiple Bank Account Linking feature that shows all balances together. Even a simple 3\u00d73 Table of [ Net Worth ] [ Received | Spend | Invested ] [ Accounts (s)Balance | Asset | Liability ] would be amazing.

  "Hi I noticed that a seperate account number and ifsc is provided for pots account . If that is already done then, The idea- Can we get a seperate Editable UPI Id for a pot account . The problem it solves - Convenient to receive payment in a pre set pot, especially for new digital creators . The Editable option will take care of privacy . How do you go about it solving right now? - For domestic use ,other payment apps where they provide option to edit upi id. If a upi id can be attached to a specific pot account ,it will be a greatly useful feature . Regards Rahul",

  "Have been using Jupiter for iOS for a few days. Apart from the mobile verification hiccups, once I logged in, everything was smooth. App opening is quick. The first UPI payment failed. So I kind of went sceptical about the payment success rate and shifted to Paytm for a while. However, I didn\u2019t face any payment issues later. The app on iOS feels more stable than android. None of my rewards were blocked too. However had some minor issues that I observed. App notifications are not yet present. I still get a text message for money deposit or debit messages even though I have enabled app notifications. UPI payment requests should be notified via app notifications rather than a text message. When logging into the app, the account balance should be set visible by default. It\u2019s an extra step to see how much money is present in the account. While making a payment, users should also have an option to add a footnote to certain payments. For example, one of a food joint in my area is registered as \u201cSM Enterprises\u201d so it would be confusing while tallying what this place actually was. Some payments made from third party apps are often displayed as PAYOUT/383910303/\u2026 which is confusing and so an additional footnote would make sense. Reward promos should strictly stay in the Reward section of the app. I see it creeping around in the Home section of the app, which is not bad per se. But very much out of context. It would be more streamlined if all the offers strictly remain the rewards section of the app. I hope to see new features added like bill payments and UPI mandates. But I have heard that these are currently being built and so for what the product is right now, it\u2019s minimal and very much functional. Very positive experience",

  "Hi, I\u2019ve been trying to create a Jupiter account for the past few days. When I add my mobile number, it says Mobile number update initiated. And I cannot move forward from here. I got in touch with customer support and after a few discussions, they got to know the issue. The phone number I used for onboarding was associated with a different customer\u2019s account in their system. And due to company policy, they\u2019re unable to delete or modify this data from their database. I recently got a new phone number and linked it with my Aadhaar & PAN. I also have a federal account with this new number. But I cannot for some reason create a Jupiter account because some X customer had used my new number previously. Now I cannot onboard Jupiter because of the said issue. The customer support says I can onboard if I get a new sim and gets it linked to my Aadhaar/PAN and that\u2019s a long, hectic process which I do not want to go through. Please allow users to create an account with any number as long as it\u2019s linked with their Aadhar and PAN. Follow the same while they change their number.

As excited as we are to be able to extend the Edge Rupay credit card to you, currently, we will not be able to offer the Edge CSB Bank RuPay credit card to you as you have already availed the Edge Federal Bank VISA credit card. We wouldn\u2019t recommend you to cancel the Edge Credit Card as the cancellation will not help in increasing the chances of being eligible for the Edge RuPay Card. Rest assured, we are working hard to extend access to the Edge RuPay credit card to all our users and you\u2019ll be notified via the Jupiter app when you are eligible for it. 11. What\u2019s the story behind the transparent card design? Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card is backed by a credit card network called RuPay - which is India\u2019s own version of Visa/ MasterCard. One of the benefits of the Rupay Card is to link the card to UPI and transact, the same way we do on our bank accounts. We thought - why not try and showcase this \u201cduality\u201d of the card in a single-split design, which brings together the \u201ctransparency\u201d of UPI with the Jupiter branding of spacefire. A transparent card represents some of the customer-centric values we hold dear at Jupiter \u2014transparency and responsibility. With the linking of credit cards to the UPI network, we\u2019re excited to bring you a symbol of our commitment to fintech innovation in India. 12. I joined the waitlist for the RuPay Credit Card, but now I am not seeing it in the app. What should I do? If you\u2019ve joined the waitlist but no longer see it in the app, consider reaching out to the Jupiter\u2019s customer support team for assistance and clarification regarding your application status. 13. How will the cashback be given to me? The jewels earned on Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card are redeemable to cash, gold, or gift cards 15 days after they are earned. This will be credited to the Federal Bank account linked with Jupiter. Conclusion: As we work on our product offerings, we\u2019d like to inform our Community about the revamps and early updates. Please share your feedback so we can collaborate together. We plan to roll out the Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card to our close friends, team members, and a few sets of users first. Let us know your thoughts on the thread below Stay tuned for more updates",

  "Hello everyone, It\u2019s been a while! I hope everyone enjoyed their long weekend Just wanted to let you know that we\u2019re in the process of revamping the Money tab The PFM team at Jupiter has been working hard on an all-new and improved Money tab, aimed at increasing awareness about your money movement. We would like to share some sneak peeks & early updates and get your early feedback before launching to a larger audience. What\u2019s new? All Bank Balances Movement: Building on the total bank balance, the balance\u2019s trendline shows how your money is moving across Jupiter and AA-linked accounts. Cashflow aka Month so far: The cashflow widget shows, at a glance, your incoming, spent, saved, invested, and remaining - so that you can stay true to your personal finance goals (more to launch on this in the near future). Month over month trends: Building on the spend categorization (It\u2019s more intuitive), now you can see monthly patterns for your running spends, savings, and investments, as well as spend categories, e.g. Food & Drinks, Bills & Utilities. \u2018Remaining\u2019 pattern: With Remaining, you can see how much you\u2019re left with each month. Put that idle cash to work.

P.S. - Some of the flows, imagery, and text are still undergoing improvements - we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll love the final flow when it\u2019s ready but do share your initial thoughts about the feature and what more would you want to see in here!

  "I have a Jupiter savings account (not Pro, as I cannot maintain 10k INR minimum balance). I see that normal savings account does not have any forex markup fee waiver, but even Pro accounts have a waiver only up to INR 1 Lac per month. When you\u2019re in a foreign land for 3 months or more, the expenses can go up real quick. Even Fi (which has same banking partner as Jupiter) offers no-limit zero forex charges. Could we see that in Jupiter too, someday? Zero forex is important to students studying abroad, and capping it to just 25000 or even 1 lac is NOT sufficient measure towards forex free. If Jupiter has same banking partner as Fi, why is it unnecessarily giving advantage of competition to its competitor? Moreover, the older 5% cashback on international transactions has also stopped. Isn\u2019t is a completely lose-lose situation now",

  "Hey there. I\u2019ve got 2 issues. I can\u2019t seem to change my mobile number to my old number.

  "Hey, So today I was at INOX and realized that I had left my Jupiter card at home. I asked them if I could UPI but they refused and told me that they don\u2019t accept it. (Ended up paying with a credit card sigh) So it got me thinking. What about making it so we can pay with our cards through NFC directly via the Jupiter app or add it onto apps like Samsung Pay or Google pay? And still get cashback or not, Cashback doesn\u2019t matter to me atleast. image696\u00d7392 46.4 KB FAQ Why not pay via UPI? My response: Some stores don\u2019t accept it. (Especially here in Kolkata) Go back and bring our card? My response: Some times we may forget or loose them and especially when you are in a situation where you are purchasing food or clothes and realize that you cannot go back and bring them/ or wait for a new card to come. And since I\u2019m travelling I cant even get a card, since I\u2019m not home. We carry our phones all the time, but not our wallets. Use Cash? My response: If we don\u2019t have our cards, we cannot withdraw cash. How does this work? My response: It is the same technology on our cards called NFC. It comes on all modern phones now a days. Safety-ness of this? My response: I guess this one matters on you, Jupiter allows us to turn on/off Contactless payments so maybe use that as a safeguard? Anyways there is a lock on financial apps like Jupiter/Gpay/Samsung pay so its pretty safe and Gpay even makes a different card number so your number is never leaked. (test it out, it works), Much safer than a card that just requires a tap to make payments without any pin. How many banks have these? My response: Many have it, like kotak, axis, icici, Federal bank (only on the Gpay app) and so on\u2026 Even OneCard the co-branded credit card has it (Gpay). You said Federal Bank is supported on Gpay so why cant we use our Jupiter cards on it? My response: Only certain Bins are given to Gpay by Federal Bank and Jupiter\u2019s bin is not on it that is why. (what is a bin? Bank Identification Number (Bin) is the first 4-6 numbers on a payment card that identifies the card issuer. The first digit is the major industry identifier, and the remaining digits communicate the financial institution that issued the card.) (What is your bin?

  "Traditional banks provide a feature where we can link our FD to the savings account and whenever there is insufficient balance, the FD would be broken on making a transaction. For example, we have linked a FD of Rs.30,000/- to the savings account and Savings account has a balance of Rs.7000/-. Now if I make a transaction of Rs.15,000/-, the insufficient balance of Rs.8,000/- which is not in Savings account will be withdrawn from the linked FD. In the same way, Jupiter can allow to link their POTS to the Savings account and whenever we are making a bill payment, providing an option to pay bills from the saved POT will make the process smoother. Because, we create POTS for quarterly/half-yearly/annual payments every month. And when the due date comes, we have to break the POT manually and make the payments. Instead if such feature where we can make the payment from POTS is provided, it would be too good. I know POTS create a Virtual RD with the partner bank and direct payment is not possible. But you can always route it through Savings account instead of manually going to respective POT and breaking such POT and then make the payment. Would like to know other members opinion and also the Jupiter team\u2019s view as well if this is possible",

  "We\u2019re thrilled to announce that our latest feature, New Fund Offerings (NFO), is now live and available for all users! What is NFO? A New Fund Offering (NFO) is like an IPO in the stock market, but for Mutual Funds. Investors can purchase units of a Mutual Fund as soon as it launches. With an NFO, you can invest in a fund at its inception, getting early access to a promising investment. Why Invest in NFOs? Early Access: NFO allows you to invest in a fund at its launch price, which can be beneficial if the fund performs well over time. Diverse Opportunities: NFOs often introduce innovative strategies, sectors, or themes that might not be available through existing funds, giving you access to fresh and diverse investment opportunities. Potential for High Returns: While all investments come with risks, NFOs can deliver substantial returns, especially if the fund manager can capitalize on market trends and opportunities. Strategic Investment: NFOs can complement your existing portfolio by adding exposure to new sectors or strategies, helping you to diversify and manage risk more effectively.

There, you\u2019ll find a dedicated collection for NFOs. Explore Available NFOs: Browse through the list of available NFOs. Each listing provides detailed information about the fund, helping you make an informed decision. Select and Invest: If you decide to invest, you can invest One-time and/or set up an SIP in the NFO. You can make multiple one-time investments in an NFO. Track your NFO investment: After investing, you can track the status of your transaction in the Transaction Tab or directly through the NFOs collection. What to check? While you try out NFOs on Jupiter, we\u2019d love to receive your honest feedback on: What did you like/dislike about the feature? Any issues that you faced while using it on the app?

  "I signed up for Jupiter a while ago but was not able to use it properly, because I switched phone and kept getting the \u201crooted phone\u201d errors for a long time, which made it impossible to access the Jupiter account because there is no web app for it (which is a very bad idea, or is there a web app that I don\u2019t know of?). I was finally able to log into the app properly today and I see that I need to maintain an NRV of Rs. 10,000 to get rewards (at another point it says I need a salary account). I had been maintaining less balance than that because I was not able to access Jupiter, but I had been using the card for small transactions. So after logging in I found out that I had not been getting rewards at all. I have no idea when this was put into place. Not just that, there is now a rs. 199 charge for debit card, and rewards are limited to salary account. How come I was not sent any kind of notification alerting me of this. I got stupid notifications about Nothing phone offer (on email and whatsapp) but not important notifications like this? So I got a few problems: Why is Jupiter introducing charges without any proper notifications? Why is Jupiter making it impossible to access our account if we don\u2019t have a phone (or have a rooted phone)? In \u201cAccount types\u201d option I see there are two types of accounts - Savings and Salary. But in some places I see the term \u201cPro\u201d account being used which is not mentioned here. How do I get rewards and use free debit card without making this my salary account? What type of account does an NRV of rs. 10,000 upgrade my account to here? How do I close my account if I want to? I really liked Jupiter when I joined and was going to make use of it once it got out of the experimentation phase it seemed to be into an year ago, but all these unwelcome surprises are making me question it",

  "Yesterday, the statement for the CSB Edge RuPay Card was generated, with a total monthly spend of 4,046. During this period, earned 810 jewels valued at 162 Rs as rewards, receiving 4% rewards on all three transactions. The statement is pretty neat and clean At present, there are three ways to redeem the jewels: Converting to Cash balance Conversion to Digital Gold and the latest addition: Conversion to Gift Cards However, it\u2019d be far more convenient if users could utilize those jewels to offset the total outstanding amount. This could be similar to OneCard\u2019s option, where one can strike off a particular transaction if there are enough points, or similar to BOB\u2019s method of automatically converting points to cash and adjusting it against the outstanding bill during statement generation",

  "I ran into this amazing app the other day- Multipl What if we can do the same if not better? I wish to buy a new MacBook Air, but I realise my savings aren\u2019t there yet. What IF Jupiter offers us Pots (specially modified for this goal), where I get to choose the monthly instalments, for a specific period of time. And I get to choose the method of investment depending on risk appetite. Mutual funds or Digital Goal. Set it for a year. At the 11th month, I get the option to pick the merchant- Amazon, Flipkart or Croma. Set up a delivery address. At the 12th hour, of the last day the POT matures, Jupiter auto places an order with the merchant, and I get my MacBook delivered without hassles in a week? I\u2019m happy.

  "After been using jupiter daily, I have some suggestions which will make jupiter more good. 1. Option to change profile or account holder photo When I opened account in jupiter, they used photo from my aadhar which was very old of me for profile photo. There is no option to change it. someone may thinking is it much important. It will be a great issue if someone has to submit digital passbook for official purposes. 2. Option to rename pot name and add notes I use lot the Pot feature in jupiter. It is a great feature for me. But sometimes when I have to change plan while saving, I have withdraw amount or destroy pot and create anoter pot for it. There isn\u2019t any option to rename the existing pot. Also the option for adding simple note for each pot will be helpful especially when someone has more pots. It will be helpful to add notes about saving plan. 3. Option to pay bills even after due date This month when tried to pay electricity bill in which its due date passed, it says \u201cyou cannot pay this bill anymore because it is past due date\u201d. While other payment apps including paytm, amazon pay, g pay allow users to pay bills even after due date, why not in Jupiter?

  "Yes, A little bit late, but hope the members here find this topic useful. World Password Day is an annual event celebrated on the first Thursday of May. The event aims to raise awareness about the importance of using strong and secure passwords to protect online accounts from hackers, and encourages users to take the \u2018Password Pledge\u2019 to assess the strength of their passwords. The event began in 2013 as an effort to educate people about the risks associated with using weak passwords and has grown in significance ever since. It is crucial not only to safeguard personal data but also to protect the data of families and businesses. A brief History: The concept of a \u201cpassword day\u201d was first proposed by security researcher Mark Burnett in his 2005 book Perfect Passwords, which urged people to update their important passwords regularly. Intel Security was inspired by his idea and declared the first Thursday in May as World Password Day in May 2013. Here are some common mistakes people make when creating passwords: Using easily guessable information such as their name, birthdate, or common words. Reusing the same password across multiple accounts. Using short passwords with less than eight characters. Using consecutive letters or numbers (e.g., \u201c1234\u201d or \u201cabcd\u201d). Not including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Using common or predictable patterns (e.g., \u201cpassword\u201d \u201cqwerty\u201d or \u201c12345\u201d). Sharing passwords with others. Writing down passwords in a location that is not secure. Here are some tips for creating a strong and secure password: Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information such as your name, birthdate, or common words. Make sure your password is at least 12 characters long. Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Consider using a passphrase instead of a password, which can be easier to remember and harder to crack. Use a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords. image823\u00d7738 100 KB",

  "Hi, All people need a big requirement in the Jupiter Application. That is the QR code to receive the payment from other UPI applications by Scanning. If you are providing the UPI in the QR Code it will lead to a big success, because if we need to receive money directly to the Jupiter account means, the only way is to type the UPI ID in the other application. That is a big problem. If you are making the QR Code of the UPI ID means it will be a big success to the application. Then the Users can easily receive the payment directly to the account. Then the user will satisfy and will they use this and Engage in this application. It will be a big achievement",

Upon checking the transaction receipt, I noticed that the \u201cPAID TO\u201d and \u201cPAID BY\u201d details are identical and display my Jupiter UPI address on both rows (mobilenumber). can anyone confirm if this is standard practice for self-transfers or if there is an issue that needs to be addressed . (Screenshot/Pic 1). And if there are no issues in this regard, there is another query : I have noticed that my full name appears on the \u201cPaid To\u201d address section, while only my first name is displayed on the \u201cPaid By\u201d address section. The second issue is concerned with the font size of the \u201cPAID BY\u201d address. As you can see, it appears smaller or tiny when compared to the font size of other details. Additionally, when viewing the same receipt on the Gmail app on my mobile device, the address appears to be split into two lines, making it look \u201cbroken.\u201d I am uncertain if this is a problem with my default font size on my mobile or if everyone else sees the same thing. Can anyone please confirm? The device is Oppo Reno 3 Pro. (Screenshot/Pic 2) Lastly, the time stamp on these receipts still shows the year 2022.

  "I havent really used pots or learnt about it until today. So I made some pots today and first of all I couldnt really find in depth information on pots, the calculations and as such. Confimed with customer support and this is what I have been told: The intereest rate will be adjusted to per day basis. 1% will be deducted from premature breaking of the pot. No matter wheen I break the pot, I will geet the principal+interest(adjusted to per day). Now my question is, why would I make New year bash pot with 61 days lock in period with 4%pa interest(adjusted to per day basis), when I can simply make a 6.25% 365 days super pot, and break it whenever I want and get an assured 5% interest (adjusted to per day rate). Told this to customer support and they agreed with this and told me theyll forward it to their Pots Team. If there is something im missing from the equation, please let me know. If this is indeed a loophole then why didnt nobody thought of this",
  "Title: Disastrous Customer Support: Account Blocked for Weeks Review: I cannot express enough my deep frustration and disappointment with this company\u2019s customer support. Not only have they demonstrated a complete lack of responsiveness and failed to address my inquiries, but they have also left my account blocked for weeks on end. This level of negligence is simply unacceptable. Despite numerous attempts to contact them through various channels, including emails and phone calls, they have chosen to ignore my pleas for assistance. It is beyond frustrating to be met with silence when trying to resolve an issue, especially when it involves accessing my own account. To make matters worse, their delayed actions have caused my account to remain blocked for an unreasonable amount of time. Weeks have passed without any sign of progress or resolution. This not only disrupts my ability to use their services but also highlights their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and timely support. The lack of answers to my emails and the absence of responses to my calls have further compounded my dissatisfaction. It is as if they have abandoned any responsibility to their customers, leaving us stranded without any form of communication or assistance. In conclusion, I am utterly appalled by the disastrous customer support provided by this company. Their failure to address my inquiries, coupled with the weeks-long blockage of my account, showcases a complete lack of accountability and disregard for their customers. I strongly advise others to steer clear of this company if they value prompt and reliable customer support",

  "Hi everyone! We\u2019re back with another uncomfortable situation around money. Most of us have already faced this. So let\u2019s get to it. Situation for the week You\u2019ve lent some money to your friend. He wanted to buy something urgently and didn\u2019t have the funds at that moment. Since you\u2019re his friend, and trying to help him out, you\u2019ve lent him the money. A few weeks later, your friend seems relaxed and looks like he has the funds to buy things for himself. On a random day, both of you go for lunch and while paying the bill, he hesitates. Nudging you to pay the bill instead. Remember, he still owes you the money you\u2019ve lent. Yet, asks for more by paying his share. It\u2019s a common story: a friend in need, an open hand, and a promise to repay. But what happens when that promise lingers unfulfilled, leaving you caught between financial strain and a strained friendship? The situation is delicate. You value your friend, yet the unpaid loan creates tension. Every reminder feels awkward, every unanswered message stings. Your choices You will need to pick 1 of the below choices: I would recall the money I lent him I would pay the bill now, remind him to pay both later Make him pay now and recall the the money I lent Something else? Comment below! 62 voters Votes are public. Results Ultimately, the decision is yours Remember, clear communication and setting boundaries early on can prevent such situations in the future. Lending money can be an act of friendship, but it\u2019s crucial to treat it like a financial transaction as well, protecting both your wallet and your bond. So, what would you do in this situation?

I\u2019d like to draw your attention to an already existing UPI feature (new to UPI 2.0?) which both Amazon Pay and BHIM app now feature. It\u2019s an option to set a custom \u2018UPI number\u2019 as your VPA to receive money. It can either be your mobile number or a 8-11 digit number. The best part is that it works cross-platform as it\u2019s a native UPI feature. \u201cNow friends/ contacts using any UPI App can send you money just by entering your phone number (or any other 8-11 digit number that you identify)\u201d. Not sure if it\u2019d be feasible on Jupiter and if Axis bank as the UPI partner would allow it. But, it\u2019s an interesting proposition nevertheless.  PS: Only works on UPI apps that enable this UPI Number feature. Working well between Amazon Pay and BHIM.

Case 2: Users see a debit transaction without initiating a transaction. (This is a rare case, but we do see users facing this) Note: A fix for this is being worked on, taking slightly longer than usual. If you are facing any of the above cases, we suggest connecting with the support team and raise a ticket. Let\u2019s use this thread to collate all POT-related issues for the above 2 cases.

  "Hi everyone! The year has just begun and we wanted to ask our Community - How does one carry their physical cards or money? Or, have we upgraded into a virtual one? Here are some options which we\u2019ve all seen. Please add if we missed any! 1. The dad wallet Ah yes, the famous good ol\u2019 dad wallet. It\u2019s big, can carry 10 or even 20+ cards and lots of notes & coins. Sounds good? But there\u2019s a drawback. It\u2019s way too bulky! You might have seen people keeping these in their back pockets. Dad wallet936\u00d7652 42.6 KB 2. Slim, portable but can\u2019t have too many Here comes the slightly fashionable and trendy wallets. You own 4-5 cards at max, a few notes, almost no coins. The materials aren\u2019t just leather anymore. Though they\u2019re classy. You might find them in a blend of nylon or Polycarbonate, polyester. Slightly lighter and durable. 3. Metal heads It\u2019s been here for a while but not many people own these. Personally, I\u2019ve shifted from slim wallets to a metal one. File/Folder style File style1090\u00d71100 59 KB Stack and compress Sliding metal wallets640\u00d7640 14.9 KB Pros: Durable, smooth and feels cold when you hold them. Smaller Cons: High tendency to scratches May bend (depends on the quality/brand) Holds up to 5-6 cards Option 2, cards may be scratched way too easily Another point to add, you can\u2019t carry any notes, coins or business cards. 4. Wallets with a Zip Its a mix of a dad wallet and the slim variants from option 2. These have a Zip, similar to a backpack. Pros: Things won\u2019t fall off that easily (Zips are harder to open - Pro or con?) Average bulge Light weight Cons: You might find it annoying to open it once in a while (Zips take longer, compared to a flip wallet) Zips may get tangled 5. Only digital Ever since the rise of UPI, there are folks who don\u2019t carry a physical card anymore. Let alone, a wallet! There are a lot of apps that can store physical card data and can be used virtually. You can pick your card of choice with a swipe, store business cards, arrange them, and so on. Not sure if these can be accessed without internet. If that\u2019s the case then, that\u2019s a bummer. Google wallet1280\u00d7720 24.8 KB Majority of us keep cards/UPI handles stored on websites & services that we use everyday. Something like an Amazon, Swiggy, Uber.

  "I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I am currently facing with changing my phone number on the Jupiter app. When attempting to update my phone number, the app indicates that my desired number is already associated with another account. I suspect this may be the same number I tried to use when initially creating my account. Unfortunately, at that time, I encountered difficulties with Aadhar verification, preventing the successful creation of the account. Since then, I have successfully created an account using a different phone number. Previously, I had initiated the account opening process using a phone number that I could not complete due to Aadhar verification issues. Consequently, that previous account remains incomplete and half-baked. Now, as I am trying to switch my currently opened account\u2019s phone number to that previous phone number which is linked with my bank accounts and Aadhaar card, the app indicates that my desired number is already associated with the incomplete KYC account which I did not open yet and now not even allowing me to proceed with the further with that account also.

  "I have been noticing a few things being fixed and improved in Jupiter in the past few weeks: The debit card wake up button works fine to wake up the debit card during sleep period. ( Bug in debit card Tab ) The personal details like UPI ID are not visible unless the biometric authentication is done. (Home page shown when opening app during biometric unlock ) Also one of the oldest bugs where it was consuming a lot of mobile data on iOS seems to be fixed ( not sure if it was bug in the iOS or the app) but seems to be fixed long back (I am noticing that now). ( High internet data consumption of app ) The help/info/FAQ icons are unified ( in almost all sections) and some other elements like search bar are more consistent throughout the UI.

  "The idea is to include the remaining balance after each transaction, in smaller font just below each debit and credit amount, in the \u201cRecent Transactions\u201d tab. This solves the problem of not knowing how much money the user had/has before/after a transaction. It will be easy to track the money flow, if the change in balance or change in the base amount is displayed after every transaction. I always have to scroll down and make a particular transaction as a base point and compare it to my current bal. to see how much is the net expenditure after that base transaction. The idea of tags can be implemented, but the idea which I have suggested in my original argument, this feature is more fundamental and more like a must-have feture which already exists in many bank applications like YONO (by SBI), and ICICI Mobile, etc. Please find a screenshot attached below, to better understand my idea. Screenshot_20230313_100052_YONO SBI1080\u00d72400 153 KB You can see that after each transaction, the balance is displayed on the bottom right of each transaction tile. This feature can make it\u2019s way to Jupiter on the \u201cAll Transactions\u201d page which can be accessed by tapping on the \u201cSee All\u201d button present at the bottom of \u201cRecent Transactions\u201d drop down menu on Home Page",

  "Hi everyone! We wanted to share an early update for a feature we\u2019ve started to rollout & you might see it in the app soon Remember last night\u2019s pizza order? Or your morning auto ride? Or the outfit you ordered. While you thought of them as plain, simple payments, did you ever think they could also help build your financial future? Well, with our newest feature, they can! 31080\u00d71080 86.1 KB Now automatically invest \u20b910 or more with every payment you make! So every time you spend, you can invest \u20b910 or more in a Mutual Fund. It\u2019s fully automatic and works in the background, while you go about spending as usual. For example, if you spend \u20b9500 on Swiggy, a minimum of \u20b910 goes to a Mutual fund of your choice. And you can set a monthly upper limit to be invested. That means if you want, you can invest only up to \u20b91500 in a month. Here\u2019s more Q. What can a \u20b910 investment even do? Even these seemingly small amounts add up over time, thanks to the power of compounding. Imagine the magic of having your daily chai contribute to your dream vacation or retirement fund! Q. Is it completely automatic? Yes, it is completely automatic. Now you don\u2019t need to remember deadlines or manually transfer funds. This feature takes care of the investing, so you can focus on enjoying life. Q. Will Jupiter pick a fund for me? You can choose the Mutual Funds of your choice! What does it look like? Here are some sneak peeks. Note: These are subject to change. You will be seeing this pop-up if you were to make a payment. Here\u2019s a snap of the UPI payment success screen. image720\u00d71720 54.2 KB Once you click on it, you will see the following: IMG_22321170\u00d72532 88.1 KB Once you get started, you will have the option to edit.

  "Hello everyone! After multiple requests from our members, we finally decided to have a chat feature for our Community! Chat1080\u00d71080 34 KB What is it? Soon, our members will have access to chat casually with other members and have private conversations with others in a seamless way. Currently, to converse with others, we have: Ability to post comments under a thread Ability to make threads Ability to chat privately (DM) Coming soon: Ability to join a channel separately and chat like WhatsApp/Slack/Discord, etc Here\u2019s what it would look like: Icon placement: Top right Chat overview Overview786\u00d71050 48.6 KB Private chat/channel view window786\u00d71042 31.7 KB While the team was testing this, we noticed it can be enabled for a group/certain set of users. We wanted to know who to enable this feature for since we\u2019ll be using it in the end. Community Champs - Special privilege Only for Active members - level (3&4) Opt in basis via Group All users? Would be spammy. 28 voters Results Note: We can limit the notifications to mention only. So you won\u2019t get spammed if you\u2019re not online. We can create multiple channels but the access for all the channels will be based on who can see them (Based on the poll above) You can join multiple channels and leave them at any point of time. However, once you leave, you cannot rejoin them. This can be fixed by asking any admin/mods. We can add any member to the channels. Does it affect leaderboard points? We\u2019re not sure yet. Though, we\u2019d like your help in order to test this theory. We think chatting in channels might not contribute to the leaderboard. Overall, the chat system is pretty clean and fun. It could replace our direct message system since it\u2019s like a thousand clicks away How we could use this? For direct chat (1on1) Casual chats that aren\u2019t relevant to the thread topic (Avoids spam) Let us know your thoughts on this. Based on everyone\u2019s decision, we\u2019ll make it happen.

This money is separate from the one in your bank balance. And the user doesn\u2019t need to maintain a balance at the date of SIP payment.(the money will be deducted from the pot directly) So, no hassle of SIP date skipping. And more beneficial to the user. Let me know your opinion too. It can be complicated for some, but according to me there are some who will admire this feature",

Some come in a faded translucent type with few patterns. But you can still see what\u2019s underneath. Also, here\u2019s a similar concept shared by  NFC enabled stickers for phones Features Jupiter should have this feature(Not sure if it can be implemented ) . A sticker that can be pasted anywhere like phones / watches, which has nfc support . My phone doesnt support tap and pay. If this was an option I would certainly buy the sticker. To me it makes more sense than carrying a debit card [image] Share your thoughts below",

A whole Investment section for SIPs and stocks. Tax related features. A service to track cheque, cancel cheque, request chequebook like debit card management services. Auto pay using UPI. Auto sweep to jupiter FD Pot facility . Desirable DP in Jupiter (I don\u2019t want to see my aadhar pic anymore). Edit or remove payee details. Round off expense money near 10, 50, 100 and save the change in selected pot or FD pot. A collateral Jupiter Credit card 95% limit against FD in jupiter pot (interest rate of FD pot should be 6.5% - 8%) . FD should be redeemable at anytime without any maturity at Rs 0 charges providing temporarily block the card on breaking the FD pot. Credit card with emi conversion (sometimes no cost) and interest free credit for some days. Dark mode. Edit Email and mobile number. Pay to UPI Number (no boundation to use multiple apps) Last and final for now, a dedication and customer satisfaction with profitable business I will edit later if i have to add or remove somthing.

  "Absolutely! Here\u2019s a breakdown of how Jupiter could improve its UPI app experience, focusing on dedicated offers and cashback, and how to frame these suggestions as requests to Jupiter: I. Enhancing Offers and Cashback within Jupiter UPI Dedicated \u201cOffers & Rewards\u201d Section: Instead of burying offers within transaction history or relying on push notifications, create a prominent \u201cOffers & Rewards\u201d section within the UPI app. This section should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and clearly categorize offers. Personalized Offers: Leverage Jupiter\u2019s data analysis to provide personalized offers based on user transaction patterns. For example: Frequent grocery shoppers get cashback on supermarket UPI transactions. Users who often pay for food delivery get discounts on partner restaurants. Utilize user location data to provide local merchant offers. Tiered Cashback/Rewards System: Implement a tiered system where users earn more rewards based on their UPI transaction volume or frequency. This could include: Base cashback on all UPI transactions. Bonus cashback for hitting monthly transaction goals. Exclusive offers for high-volume users. Partner Merchant Offers: Forge partnerships with popular online and offline merchants to offer exclusive UPI cashback and discounts. Promote these partnerships prominently within the \u201cOffers & Rewards\u201d section. Gamification: Introduce gamified elements like: \u201cStreaks\u201d for consecutive daily UPI transactions. \u201cChallenges\u201d to earn bonus rewards. \u201cSpin the wheel\u201d or scratch card options for random rewards. Clear and Transparent Cashback Tracking: Provide a clear and real-time view of earned cashback and rewards within the app. Ensure easy redemption of cashback to the user\u2019s Jupiter account. Inform the user of expiring offer and cashback. II. Framing Requests to Jupiter Here\u2019s how you can phrase your suggestions as constructive requests to Jupiter: Subject: Enhancing Jupiter UPI with a Dedicated Offers & Rewards Section Body: \u201cDear Jupiter Team, I\u2019m a loyal Jupiter user and I appreciate the convenience of your UPI feature. To further enhance the user experience, I\u2019d like to suggest the implementation of a dedicated \u2018Offers & Rewards\u2019 section within the Jupiter UPI app.\u201d \u201cThis section could feature personalized offers, partner merchant discounts, and a tiered cashback system, making it more engaging for users.\u201d \u201cSpecifically, I would like to request that you consider the following:\u201d \u201cCreating a visually appealing \u2018Offers & Rewards\u2019 tab.\u201d \u201cImplementing personalized offers based on transaction history and location.\u201d \u201cDeveloping a tiered cashback system to incentivize frequent UPI usage.\u201d \u201cPartnering with popular merchants to provide exclusive UPI offers.\u201d \u201cAdding gamification elements to make rewards more engaging.\u201d \u201cProviding clear and transparent cashback tracking and redemption.\u201d \u201cAdding a system that notifies users of expiring offers and cashback.\u201d \u201cI believe these improvements would significantly increase user engagement and make Jupiter UPI an even more valuable tool. Thank you for your consideration",

  "So I recently checked out the pots and really liked the concept of that for separating the bills amount so that it will not be used for anything else.

  "I have reached you guys many times via call and email regarding my issue.

I had got my phone stolen on Dec 13 and along with it, I lost my sim which was registered under my sister\u2019s name and she is abroad right now. So I couldn\u2019t get a duplicate of it. I went to the nearest federal Bank and updated my phone number over there and I had filled the email address registered on the form. They said I\u2019d get access to Jupiter in 24hrs. Now that I am trying to login to my Jupiter, it shows a message that \u201cthe email is address is registered to another number (old number)\u201d. I reached out to your customer support via call and chat number of times which I found to be a complete waste of time and energy. I had no issue with updating phone number at Kotak Mahindra which is my salary account. Why do you guys have no way of verifying an existing user other than phone number? I even got my Pan card and aadhar updated while you guys still have trouble sorting my issue out. Not even a ticket numbe was raised even after reaching out so many times. How can I trust someone like you when I have my savings pot stuck inside it? Is there no way for your system to authenticate an existing customer other than using phone number?

But here they are saying that I have to change my PAN Card details and then do the verification. While my father\u2019s details were being entered it was correct. Don\u2019t know how and why the caste was entered like this twice. Any word of advise on how and what to do regarding this? Since I don\u2019t want my Jupiter account to be closed",

  "A few months ago I tried to purchase something from Amazon USA using Jupiter DC and then eBay USA and Temu.com and get it shipped to my sister in US. Jupiter denied the transactions citing some suspicious activity. Eventually I did the 3 transactions using Niyo Global debit card and IDFC First WOW credit card, both of which are 0 forex. Just an area for you guys to improve if you care. Have a feature in the app where the user can mark or \u201cinform\u201d the app that he\u2019s gonna do an international transaction, maybe via OTP or some extra verification in advance. And THEN DON\u2019T DENY THE TRANSACTION. Generally, if international transactions are off by default, logging in to the app and turning them on should be enough. But it wasn\u2019t in my case as the transaction failed.

  "Hi guys! Quick intro - I lead the debit card business at Jupiter and we are currently racking your brains to figure how to pack more goodness into the card! One of the things we are considering is: INSURANCE! Yes most cards in the market come with some kind of insurance but we want to make sure that we add something that is actually useful to the user. Now, if I were to ask folks which insurance they would like - the most common answer would be health insurance or mobile insurance! But honestly, these are QUITE expensive to be given as a free add-on To give you an idea, a decent health cover can cost more than 10-15k annually, depending on your age and type of coverage. But we still want to give you something that is actually beneficial to you and adds value to your financial and personal life! So how about hospitalization coverage against accidents? If you ever have any kind of accident and need hospitalisation due to that, your cost of medical treatment would be covered upto the sum insured. So you can have the peace of mind to not worry about sudden expenses and cash crunch in an emergency! The only caveat for availing this insurance is that you should have used your debit card at least once in the last 30 days. That\u2019s all! Do hit one of the options below to let us know if you\u2019d like this feature on your card and drop any other ideas/ thoughts in comments! Accidental Hospitalization Cover sounds useful to me I don\u2019t need an Accidental Hospitalization Cover I don\u2019t really know/ care 80 voters Results",

  "The availability of Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) schemes has made purchasing high-value items much more convenient for customers. EMI schemes allow customers to pay for the product over an extended period of time, rather than paying the full amount upfront. However, this convenience can also lead to impulsive buying behavior, where customers make purchases without fully considering the financial impact of the EMI payments. Participants in the thread share their personal experiences with EMI schemes and impulsive buying behaviour and provide tips for avoiding impulsive purchases. The discussion highlights the need for customers to be mindful of their spending habits and to make informed decisions when considering EMI schemes. What is EMI? To attract more customers and increase sales, merchant outlets and credit card companies in India offer Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) payment schemes. This is particularly helpful for customers who may not have the immediate funds to make a purchase but can afford to pay in instalments over a period of time. EMI is a popular payment option for electronic appliances, mobiles, laptops, and other gadgets, where customers can buy the product and start using it immediately while paying for it in smaller instalments spread over a longer duration. EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is a fixed amount of money that a borrower pays to a lender on a monthly basis, usually for a loan or credit card payment. The EMI includes both the principal amount and the interest charged on the loan. EMI is commonly used for payments related to loans for personal expenses, education, vehicles, homes, and other assets. What is Impulsive Buying? Impulsive buying is the act of making a purchase without prior planning or consideration, often based on emotions, desires, or immediate needs rather than careful evaluation of the product or service. Impulsive buyers tend to make quick purchasing decisions without fully considering the long-term consequences or benefits of the purchase. This behavior is often driven by factors such as advertisements, peer pressure, discounts, and emotions like excitement or stress. Impulsive buying can lead to overspending, financial stress, and buyer\u2019s remorse, particularly when the purchased item turns out to be unnecessary or of low quality. So here are some of the questions for the community friends: Have you ever made a purchase using an EMI scheme? If so, What was the first product you purchased on EMI? Which EMI plan do you prefer the most (3 months, 6 months etc etc\u202624 months)? Have you ever faced any difficulties after purchasing for friends or family members using EMI? (like missed payments) In your opinion, does the availability of EMI options lead to impulsive buying behaviour?

  "Most Wanted from Banks: I want my bank to fight for me and have my back when I encounter issues such as refund problems , poor product/service quality , or online fraud . It\u2019s frustrating and time-consuming to deal with merchants on my own. The bank should at least send an email to the merchant regarding my issue and have customer support guide me through these situations. In the past, when I was a victim of online fraud , the bank didn\u2019t help me much . They just told me to file a FIR and fill out a form in person , but didn\u2019t mention the option of registering a complaint on the cyber department\u2019s website , informing the sender and receiver banks and platforms , or calling the cyber fraud helpline . It would also be great if banks had a blog on these topics to educate their customers and make them feel safe and secure when making purchases or sending money . I want the refund and chargeback process to be simple and have the bank\u2019s team guide me through it. I\u2019d even choose a bank that provides strong support over one that offers more rewards and cashbacks . This is a big problem in the banking industry today and I believe neo banks have the potential to solve it and be game-changers . However, neo banks are still dependent on their partner banks for handling transaction disputes , so there\u2019s still a wait for that. Nonetheless, neo banks should not neglect this issue or they won\u2019t be able to differentiate themselves from traditional banks .

This authorization is mainly used while entering an account. 2FA adds an extra layer of security that can be used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. As the name suggests, it provides two different authentication factors to verify themselves, for example, it includes security questions, SMS messages, OTPs, pushes notifications, etc",

  "Hi, I have a Jupiter account and I needed to change the communication address since I have moved cities, I looked into the app to change the address but there is no option, so I contacted Jupiter Helpdesk, they said address change is currently not possible. Hence today I went to Federal Bank, Andheri East to change my communication address since Jupiter is using Federal Banking services for the saving bank. I was told my Federal Bank that address change is not available for Jupiter account holders, it can only be done for Federal Saving Accounts, we need to contact Jupiter for that, I said Jupiter told me there is no such option with them, I was told by the Federal Bank employee that sorry it is not possible to change the address. I have searched this community for similar topics and have found countless topics opened for the same issue, I don\u2019t understand how a basic feature like address change not available in the app, you have time for features like Pots and Pans but a basic feature like Address Change is not possible for you ? I will unfortunately not be able to use your world class bank app since this simple feature not being available becomes a deterrent, tomorrow if there is some financial issue operating your app, and you ask for identification documents, you will deny solution stating the address do not match with the documents provided and with the address available with your bank. I will be left in a problematic situation. I would like to also suggest other customers not to invest/save your hard earned money in this app, you never know what sort of problems you could face if a simple address change feature is not available, your money could get stuck for good"
