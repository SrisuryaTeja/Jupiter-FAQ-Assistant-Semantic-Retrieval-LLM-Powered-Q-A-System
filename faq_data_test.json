They‚Äôre like stickers for your card.\nThere were some discussions internally about having one but, we‚Äôre still thinking about it \nIntroducing-41080√ó1080 109 KB\nWe wanted to hear the community‚Äôs thoughts about these as well. Do you own or used one before?\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen any Debit card skins, here are some examples:\n1569√ó569 24.4 KB\nScreenshot 2022-11-22 at 3.08.51 PM852√ó566 32 KB\nThey come in 2 types.\n\nCovers the whole card, like shown above or,\nCovers everything else except the numbers and info, for example below.\n\nScreenshot_2022-11-08-16-55-16-50_1c337646f29875672b5a61192b9010f91080√ó733 44.7 KB\nSome thoughts:\n\nIt‚Äôs better to have a full cover in our case since the space fire debit card is blank in the front and the numbers are behind.\nWe also think keeping the OG spacefire colour is needed since that‚Äôs what we started with and that‚Äôs how our users remember us. In this case, would it be better to keep translucent skin instead?\nWe wanted to keep this for special users. Community folks maybe? \n\nFor example, gift box wraps. Some come in a faded translucent type with few patterns. But you can still see what‚Äôs underneath.\nAlso, here‚Äôs a similar concept shared by @Aswin_Benny\n  \n    \n    \n    NFC enabled stickers for phones Features\n  \n  \n    Jupiter should have this feature(Not sure if it can be implemented ) . A sticker that can be pasted anywhere like phones / watches, which has nfc support . \nMy phone doesnt support tap and pay. If this was an option I would certainly buy the sticker. To me it makes more sense than carrying a debit card \n [image]\n  \n\n\nShare your thoughts below!\n@trust_level_1",

They‚Äôre like stickers for your card.\nThere were some discussions internally about having one but, we‚Äôre still thinking about it \nIntroducing-41080√ó1080 109 KB\nWe wanted to hear the community‚Äôs thoughts about these as well. Do you own or used one before?\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen any Debit card skins, here are some examples:\n1569√ó569 24.4 KB\nScreenshot 2022-11-22 at 3.08.51 PM852√ó566 32 KB\nThey come in 2 types.\n\nCovers the whole card, like shown above or,\nCovers everything else except the numbers and info, for example below.\n\nScreenshot_2022-11-08-16-55-16-50_1c337646f29875672b5a61192b9010f91080√ó733 44.7 KB\nSome thoughts:\n\nIt‚Äôs better to have a full cover in our case since the space fire debit card is blank in the front and the numbers are behind.\nWe also think keeping the OG spacefire colour is needed since that‚Äôs what we started with and that‚Äôs how our users remember us. In this case, would it be better to keep translucent skin instead?\nWe wanted to keep this for special users. Community folks maybe? \n\nFor example, gift box wraps. Some come in a faded translucent type with few patterns. But you can still see what‚Äôs underneath.\nAlso, here‚Äôs a similar concept shared by @Aswin_Benny\n  \n    \n    \n    NFC enabled stickers for phones Features\n  \n  \n    Jupiter should have this feature(Not sure if it can be implemented ) . A sticker that can be pasted anywhere like phones / watches, which has nfc support . \nMy phone doesnt support tap and pay. If this was an option I would certainly buy the sticker. To me it makes more sense than carrying a debit card \n [image]\n  \n\n\nShare your thoughts below!\n@trust_level_1",
