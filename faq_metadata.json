I thank Jupiter for teaching me not to trust this so called NEO banks at least as of now. We are still very far behind in terms of support. And you all know finance is one of the sectors whose backbone is support. Even SBI has far better support than Jupiter . Anyone can be in the situation where I\u2019m today. Any only hope I have as of now is that they will give me at least any response, apart from that I have no option",

        "text": "I opened jupiter account on 9th May 2022 today completed its first year.I would like to share this one year experience of using Jupiter. The main reason i opened jupiter was that my debit card from bank of india was getting delayed alot,one day suddenly i saw an ad and i got interested then i opened jupiter account. After opening the Jupiter account, I see that it is much better than my BOI account, better rewards, no branch visit , onboarding process was smooth and quick. Early on I used Jupiter for transactions, and to be honest I used it more for Jewel and even then I didn\u2019t have much money, not more than 4-5 thousand. Features Then vs Now: Then: I remember when i opened jupiter there was - Delay in balance update No Super Pots No Investment ( Mutual fund,FD,Gold) No Bill Payments No Mobile Number Change option No Tax Statement No Habits No cheque book No Nach payments No international transfer Only a typical savings and salary account. Now- Almost everything present and more on the way\u200b Things i use in Jupiter - Savings account for savings, upi transaction, POTS for small targets and use FDs as well. Jupiter UPI and card for 1% reward, i had auto payments through debit card. Electricity bill payments. Things i don\u2019t use in Jupiter - Mutual fund: as i already have a demat account in Groww thats why I don\u2019t use jupiter. Digital Gold: I don\u2019t like digital gold as with every buy 3% gst, sometimes prices are different from actual price and much more. Prepaid recharge: Actually i prefer credit card for most of recharge as I recharge the mobiles of my neighbors, friends and many others.So if I do all the recharges through bank then bank balance will be low and if I do it through credit card I get reward point and that moment the money is not leaving from my bank.I also had Jiopos lite and i top up it through credit card. Cons- The annual charges on debit card. When i opened jupiter they said it\u2019ll be free forever but now it is not. Although I don\u2019t have any problem with charges. Overall my experience with jupiter is great. I love jupiter and i am not going anywhere. Everyone share his/her experience, we all are listening",

        "text": "Happy Anniversary Bro The sole reason for me opening a Jupiter account was because of its theme colour , including the colour of its debit card. Orange is my favourite colour, and the \u201cspacefire\u201d theme almost resembled of it. I opened my Jupiter account on November 14th, 2021, which happens to be Children\u2019s Day . A technologically advanced friend of mine had opened his Fi account a day before and had suggested I open an account too. After he spoke at length about its features and how it was going to change the future of banking, I searched for more details about Fi by Federal Bank but ended up on the Jupiter website and app. Upon seeing the colour and design of the debit card (the first vertical debit card I had ever seen and ever had), I decided to go for a Jupiter account and recommended it to my family and friends. During the early days, we mainly used Jupiter to earn Jewels as the concept of joining rewards and jewels was a new experience for all of us. From 2021 to 2023, I am proud to have been a part of this wonderful product and consider myself lucky enough to have witnessed its growth . As Sujit Ghosh pointed out, Jupiter had a simple and humble beginning, and who would have thought that they would grow to be this large in the future with tons of innovative features such as Jupiter Pro, Salary Account, Digital Gold, Super Pots, Mutual Funds, Bill payments, and many more Surojit Ghosh: The annual charges on debit card. When i opened jupiter they said it\u2019ll be free forever but now it is not. Although I don\u2019t have any problem with charges. I believe there are specific conditions for waiving debit card charges, and meeting them would result in no charges being incurred",

Guess, I was lucky as the existing community members worked with the Jupiter Team during the time before me to introduce the features that made it a strong proposition for me to ditch my existing bank. My biggest win by far with Jupiter is to be able to offer salary accounts to my employees. Has gone a long in building trust and confidence. I extensively use credit cards for bill payments. Hence, I have not used the bill payment feature as frequently. On the occasions I have used it, the experience has been seamless. I did start SIPs for Mutual Funds on Jupiter. I choose not to track my external portfolio here to avoid confusion. I like things separate. On the debit card debate that ensued, I saw it more from Jupiter\u2019s perspective as I also help my boss run his business. Having said that I respect everyone\u2019s opinion on this.

I opened Account with Jupiter by seeing CashKaro\u2019s Offer in June 2022. I searched about Jupiter on YouTube (never heard about FI still January 2023) Opened account because its procces was so simple (without VKYC). Then after using for 1 week i noticed that Jupiter was tracking my other Bank Account balances (I was unaware about this is one of main feature\ud83d\ude05). I was start feel kinda Uncomfortable with this because Jupiter was Tracking my Transaction, balance etc. And also found that, one of youtube Influencers was negatively talking about same that he also feeling uncomfortable about this. So i also sacred, and Uninstalled Jupiter. Then, after in Feb 2023 i recieved msg from jupiter for completing Full VKYC. Then i again searched about neo banking and, then i understand and got known everything about Neo banking. Then i felt comfortable to download Neo banking but i was using Jupiter as just Extra account without any transactions. After some weeks I got known about JUPITER COMMUNITY. Then feel too much comfortable to use Jupiter then completed my Full KYC with Jupiter and become Pro Customer, And i have also tried Mutual fund SIP in this month. (I loved that i can skip SIPs and also there is no charge). Conclusion- COMMUNITY had played big roll to retain with Jupiter and permanent customer. If I hadn\u2019t visited the community that day, I wouldn\u2019t be using Jupiter today. For Neo banking 2nd point is that, Customers should know what is NeoBank and how it works and how funds are safe with them. What different features they have and how they work. Because of i was unaware about all so , I was uninstalled Jupiter from June to Feb. - I missed lot in this gap",

The way I use pots is that I deposit money very frequently into some of them but the issue is that the pots I deposit into are buried deep into \u201cView all\u201d list. It gets mentally exhausting to have to go through a total of 3 clicks, the added cognitive load and distractions along the way to just add 200Rs to a pot. It would make my life a lot easier if I had access to some of my pots that I could either favorite or pin, either in the home screen or at the pots page to help with this. Another idea could also be widgets in iOS to allow for quick access to the pots of our choice. Or even the long press on an icon. Some kind of quick access is all I\u2019m asking for. What if Jupiter just gave different parts of the app quick access to the user based on their personal needs and niche usages. Make them all quick-accessible in some way. For me it\u2019s pots for someone else it could be gold. Who knows. All in all I think Jupiter has reached a mature stage in design and it\u2019s time to focus on some nifty experience uplifting features that truly make a user go \u201caha\u201d.

You can order the same from your App under Account Services option on top left of the home page. Today, I tried ordering the Cheque Book, even mailed my signature and Pan Card (less than 100kb in size). But, support team informed me that cheque book service is not currently available as they are facing a technical disruption, further I was informed that they don\u2019t know when is it going to be resumed and engineers are working on it. So, as of now no cheque facility , I hope Jupiter team works on it and bring it back online",

Also, you can check the following threads for a possible solution Mutual fund insights report bug Bug hunters [Peek 2022-06-02 17-20]  is was the bug that i was telling about\u2026 Check the issues with values. 1432 is my current value as per june 2\u2026 But insights are fetched on may 28(i had to manually request it)\u2026 To update insights everytime, i had to manually request for CAM mail and forward it\u2026 Shouldnt it be automatically updated? Consider shifting to MF central API Investments Club Jupiter Assets get the mutual funds from CAMS, and for some reason, it doesn\u2019t show my total investments. I invest via DMAT format (Zerodha coin). Other platforms which use MFcentral are showing my total investments. External mutual fund dashboard not showing Help Hi, I don\u2019t see the external mutual fund dashboard, nor the money dashboard showing amount, i just see explore option here, but don\u2019t see the invested amount",

        "text": "One probable reason could be because your mutual funds are in demat format. For example: Mutual fund investments through Paytm Money or Zerodha Coin are held in demat format. And Jupiter uses CAMS email statement for tracking your external funds. CAMS doesn\u2019t get the demat mutual funds. I suppose we are in a great time of change in Financial India. So things are getting ironed out everywhere - CAMS, Jupiter, etc. As of now, MF Central tracks mutual fund investments in demat format. IND Money and Fi Money uses MF Central service as of now. But Jupiter is also planning to switch to MF Central soon. Guess we all need to be patient until then. Hoping soon is sooner",

Fuel surcharges General This is not an issue. But a standard reverse charge applied by merchant to all cards. Some cards choose to give waiver and bear the cost but it is 2.5% so it doesn\u2019t make sense in case of Debit cards for waiver unless it is HNI client card. I remember back in 2005, it used to be key USP for any CC as 0% surcharge for fuel and no other rewards. Fuel surcharges General Recently 10 rs Debited from my account as Fuel Surcharge after using Debit card on fuel pump. Thats mean, jupiter doesn\u2019t provide fuel charge waiver. But, many times i have used my jupiter DC for fuel but its 1st time that 10rs debited as fuel surcharges. Can anyone explain this? I have already contacted with team. I think not only Jupiter but almost all debit cards charges those fees/charges (unless it is some co-branded fuel cards) For me, SBI charges those fees on my debit card",

Thank you for participating in the previous topics, it\u2019s nice to see folks who are relating to the series and sharing your real life inputs! Looking forward to see more If you missed them, here they are! Uncomfortable Money situations #1 - Paying at the dinner table \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Uncomfortable money situations #2 - Lent money, but didn't get it back? \ud83d\udcb0 So, let\u2019s move on to our next situation for the week. Situation of the week Since Valentines day just got over, let\u2019s have one around that You\u2019re on a date. (Assuming the Guy POV). You went to movies, parks, a pet cafe, and even had some window shopping. It\u2019s been a fun day and finally you\u2019re having a dinner date. Both of you order drinks, a platter and had fun conversations. When you call for the bill, both of you stare at the bill and look a each other. Predicting, who will make the first move to pay. An awkward situation, don\u2019t you think? What would you do? Vote below Man up, pay the bill as a treat Ask your date to pay as a treat Pay the bill now, ask for the share later Talk about splitting the bill Is there an other way? Share below! 30 voters Votes are public. Results There\u2019s no single, universally accepted answer to who pays for the bill on a date. It depends on various factors and has evolved greatly over time due to changing societal norms and expectations. Remember: The focus should be on enjoying the date and getting to know each other. Don\u2019t let the bill cloud the experience. Flexibility and understanding are key. Be open to different approaches and respect each other\u2019s preferences. Clear communication: Talking about finances beforehand can prevent misunderstandings and ensure a more enjoyable experience for both. What would you do in this situation? Let us know in the comments below if you\u2019ve faced this situation or a similar one. How did you deal with it? Happy Friday",

I spent a few minutes studying how they work, and it was immediately obvious to me that they were useless to me. Every pot I create is to save for a future expense. When I need the money is not always precise. I kinda know that I\u2019ll need the money by around 2nd week of March, but it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s 9th March or 17th March. Jupiter automatically destroying the super pot on maturity is a bad idea. Instead, on maturity, why not convert the super pot to a regular pot and keep the money in the pot itself? That way, I don\u2019t lose track of how much money I have for each expense. I also can benefit from the higher interest earned by super pots",

        "text": "Even I do like the concept of pots with mutual fund as underlying investment rather than regular deposits of bank. Thanks  for creating this thread. I would like to contribute my points too. Pots should be goal specific like Save for Tomorrow (Long Term), Buy a Phone in 6 months (Short Term). Depending on that respective funds can be suggested with their lock in period. Pots can be distributed into 3 levels as per user risk appetite like : (i) Low Risk - Liquid Fund (Short Term) (ii) Medium Risk - Large Cap Fund (Long Term) (iii)High Risk - A Flexi Cap Fund (Long Term) I think these three levels would be enough in beginning as many novice users or young generations would be exploring mutual fund markets for first time via Jupiter itself. So, this shouldn\u2019t be a tough decision choice to read and research a lot about funds like small cap, other categories. Maybe after a long time you can introduce a (iv) Very High Risk - Index / Small Cap etc. Pots Alive Time : As users would be new so they should be adviced about taxation : LTCG and STCG on Debt and Equity Related Fund. Plus a small nudge or notification from time to time like \u201cLonger you hold, more you\u2019ll benefit.\u201d \u201cTry to make a Streak to grow your Investment Plant as Pot for 1yr and bear the fruits in future\u201d. Provide Monthly Badges as appreciation for being invested. Then people will be motivated to hold longer. As per current industry standards of : Redemption Day + 2 Working Days.

        "text": "So about two months ago, I changed my mobile number through the Jupiter Bank app. The number changed successfully and the UPI ID began reflecting my new number. However, UPI transactions, both incoming and outgoing, started failing. I contacted support, they asked for 48 hours, then got in touch and asked for details I had already given them in writing. I had to do this whole charade at least 10 times in the intervening period. Every time i had to start explaining from scratch, none of the support people bothered to read the original complaint. Then they asked me for screenshots. Which their app does not allow. So they asked me to take a video of the screen from another phone. Which is dumb, considering I gave them exact issue details and the exact error message. But I did it anyway. After that, over the next few weeks, they asked me to do several things such as logout and login, delete app cache and data, uninstall and reinstall app, and practically everything else, and they asked me to take the stupid videos from another phone every time. Because they didn\u2019t trust my reading skills, perhaps. I did every freaking thing they said, NOTHING worked. As of today, I can login to my bank, my UPI ID is visible, but I cannot add any accounts. If I try to link my Jupiter / Federal Bank, it just says \u201cPartner server error\u201d in a purple box. If I try to add other bank accounts, it reaches the last stage and then says \u201cThere was an issue with this transaction\u201d in a gray box. They asked me for videos of this too, and I sent that as well. Now for the past two weeks, they just keep telling me they\u2019re \u201cescalating\u201d the issue with all the \u201cstakeholders\u201d. Nothing else. It has been two months with zero progress. Mind, every time i get in touch, they ask me to tell them what the issue is again, and they ask for videos of the errors again. The absolute dumbest part about this whole mess is that my Jupiter / Federal account is fully functional for UPI on GPay, PayTM and Samsung Pay. Their own app isn\u2019t accepting their own account, or any other account for UPI or spend tracking. No less, the fact that i can\u2019t even try reverting back to my old number, because they only allow you to change mobile numbers once in a year. For the past week, all i get in reply is the \u201cescalating\u201d nonsense. I have given up hope, and am killing my jupiter account. They\u2019ve probably escalated this to god himself by now, with no resolution in sight. A word of advice. Jupiter is buggy garbage. Skip it. Feedback to Jupiter: This is not how you run a bank. The mobile number change limitation is stupid. If you\u2019re going to ask for screenshots and videos every time i put in a complaint, remove the idiotic screenshot restriction from the app. Your chat support is buggy garbage too. The longer a conversation goes on, the more the dumb thing lags. At this point, a word i type in chat takes about ten seconds to show up on the screen. I think you\u2019re doing this intentionally to dissuade people from using chat support. Bye bye",

Cards1080\u00d71080 112 KB While the idea of a redesigned app has always been on the cards, the team started working on it in November 2023. 6 months and 600 screens later, we\u2019re ready to go live with a Jupiter that\u2019s bolder, more confident, and true to our mission of improving the financial wellness for millions of people.

The interface is smoother and faster, illustrations are bolder, typography is modern & unique, and key numbers are in the spotlight. But there\u2019s more to come, so keep an eye on your Jupiter app. Ok Jupiter, show me the new colour palette To give you a picture, these are the colours we\u2019ll mostly be known for image1334\u00d71314 63 KB Let\u2019s break it done, shade by shade. The stark white has been paired with a warm beige. This is a easier on the eyes, even if you\u2019re looking at your screen in maximum brightness. We also introduced teal, light green, yellow ochre, and darker greys in our palette. These act as pops of colour, without being overwhelming. The iconic spacefire orange still remains, but in accents and highlights. While the Jupiter app you knew and loved was bright and playful with a unique space them, the Jupiter we\u2019ve now created is modern, confident, and focused completely on tools for your financial wellness. But why did we redesign the app? A consistent and seamless user experience: As you move from one screen to another, across Pots, investments, loans, or credit card \u2013 the app now feels like parts of a whole rather than disconnected parts. Trust & transparency: The new app brings key numbers, data, and insights at the forefront of your experience. This is to encourage a transparent relationship with your money.

Generally, it takes 24 hrs to update the pots balance, so i thought it will get updated. Now, After 4 days I saw that the balance was not updated yet. So, I added \u20b9500 more on 22nd February to check if that might update it. Now, Here\u2019s the issue, the amount that I have added on 22nd gets updated but the amount on 18th February is still missing. I contacted the support via app and they said that they will resolve the query and balance will be credited by 27th February. Now, on 27th February they closed the ticket and marked it as resolved but the amount was not credited. I had provided them with statements screenshot in that ticket number and now that resolved query itself is missing from the application help section. So, I mailed them stating the whole issue and with pictures of the issue. At this point the balance is updated in cashflow section but not in pots section. After a very long discussion over call, they said they will escalate the problem but can not tell me when the issue will be resolved and they will keep it window open but on the application they mentioned that they will contact me with a follow up in 3 working days but they are yet to contact me which I think they won\u2019t cause their customer support said that he can\u2019t tell me when the issue will be resolved. The amount should be \u20b93200 instead of \u20b92700 Ticket Number : 3056459 photo_2024-03-01_20-30-12720\u00d71280 148 KB photo_2024-03-01_20-30-17720\u00d71280 141 KB Explanation of Screenshots: the first screenshot shows the correct amount of \u20b93200 that is shown when you click \u201cView Pots\u201d in \u201cSaved\u201d section but the moment you click the pot to break it. It will show \u20b92700 . The money is still missing and Support is not helping at all. Moral of the Story: Do not invest in pots no matter how good you think the concept. It might happen to you too with much more amount. FYI: The issue is now resolved. 12 days to resolve it. 18 Feb 2024 - 2 March 2024",

We are trying to make our Community more accessible since we use it a lot Thought: How about we replace one of the main tabs on the Jupiter app with Community? (Home/Payments/Money/Card/Salary or PRO) - Most likely the last one. Or another section itself? We\u2019re trying to find out if the navigation would be easier if it\u2019s right up front.

        "text": "Here are my initial observations - From UX perspective The FD option is hidden as a small tab under investments. Can be difficult to find. Suggest it be moved to the Money tab like pots. Makes it easy for anyone to find it as the money tab is more frequently used. While creating the FD, while it is convenient to see the interest rate that will be applied, what can be concerning is the statement that says actual maturity amount will be available after booking the FD. This statement comes up when the user clicks on the additional information icon. Either it be placed more prominently without the need to click on information icon along with the conditions that affect the maturity value or those conditions be placed inside the information box. The first step towards creating the FD is verification. This step is redundant for full KYC accounts. The next page that comes up states the KYC details are being checked and will take 72 hours to get updated. Again, redundant for a full KYC user. The the close page icon on the top left hand corner does not work. To go back to the previous screen the on screen back button needs to be used The display within the information box needs more work. It looks unfinished. When compared to the Paytm Payments Bank (comparison with large banks will not be correct), what works is 3 different tenures are displayed right at the beginning making the choice easier. What can adopted is the interest earning chart where the user is clearly shown at what life cycle stage of the FD what interest is he earning. This gives the user a better idea of the interest earned at any given point in time",

See Bait-and-switch - Wikipedia At the time of opening the savings account, it was told to be a zero balance account. There was no account closure charges if done within 14 days, or after 6 months. Now Federal Bank has sent out an email saying the zero balance will be removed, and moreover, there is no option to close the account without paying service charge! It has been 10 days since that mail from Federal Bank, but no communication from Jupiter clearly showing they are complicit in this scam. I understand the company is under pressure to start raking in the moolah to show the numbers to the investors, but taking this route of scamming customers cannot be accepted. Hence, please restore the original terms and conditions immediately, or provide an option to close the account without charges",

It\u2019s now a place to meet new people, get to know their stories, share news and ideas, learn new concepts, test the product with community members, and create memories together. Now, I invite you to share your story on how you discovered the Jupiter Community and what made you stay If you have links to fun topics that didn\u2019t get covered here, feel free to share them below! Thank you all for co-creating with us. Looking forward to 2023",

Since it\u2019s the festive season, folks are planning and buying gifts for friends and family in advance. We\u2019d like to give some extra gifts from our side Untitled design1080\u00d71080 59.3 KB So, what's Big Bang Days? This is a campaign where you can win rewards every day! Starting today till 24th Dec, 2022. Each day, there will be a different reward. The reward will be given to the top 10 spenders for that particular day. Note: The same person will not be eligible for the next reward. In total, there will be 5 winners and 5 rewards. Reward list for this version: Screenshot_2022-12-20-15-30-33-78_e307a3f9df9f380ebaf106e1dc980bb6966\u00d71526 56.9 KB Dec 20th - Hyatt experience worth Rs. 15,000 Dec 21st - Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic Dec 22nd - Bose Sports Earbuds Dec 23rd - Amazon Gift Card worth Rs. 15,000 Dec 24th - MakeMyTrip Gift Card worth Rs. 15,000 Read in app T&C and rules for more information. It\u2019s a limited-time campaign. Big Bang Days would be back again during sale seasons, and special occasions. Now is your chance to make a big bang! Improving campaigns We\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on how we can make our rewards campaign better. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up for future campaigns. Adding a progress bar The Nothing campaign for example had 4 rewards and folks had to reach a milestone with claim rewards. Users may not know if their transactions are being considered for the milestone reward so  suggested we add a progress bar. This bar shows the transactions you\u2019ve done and how far it is from the cap. Selecting the rewards We\u2019d like to hear your wishlist! Based on suggestions, we will try to add the suggested rewards with the highest number of votes. (Likes) Let us know in the comments below, which kind of reward you would like to see in campaigns. Gamified experience We\u2019d like to have a gamified experience as you use Jupiter. Quest For Metal, and Savings Challenge are some of them. We\u2019re all open ears when it comes to concepts and ideas to make more! Is anyone up for brainstorming? Yes, Count me in! Maybe later. 8 voters Votes are public. Results People who say yes will be part of a call with team members and we\u2019ll come up with a campaign together. Can\u2019t wait to hear your suggestions",

Initially, CC on UPI utilizing the normal UPI network for accepting payments but now, gradually, NPCI has built a separate network solely for CC on UPI. Tieup with all payment gateways, payment companies and big merchants. Big merchants require direct certification from NPCI or an NPCI partner to accept CC on UPI. That is why some big merchants are still not accepting CC on UPI. If you have noticed, there are some online big merchants who initially accepted CC on UPI, then either stopped or removed the UPI option in between, and now have started accepting CC on UPI again. Why is that ? Because all big merchants need to tieup separately for the CC on UPI network. The reason for the \u20b910 surcharge mentioned in the OP\u2019s question is because CC on UPI operates on the credit network. This is not the normal UPI network. Now, Credit Line on UPI products are also coming up. You might have read the news that NPCI recently partnered with Razorpay and PayU for accepting Credit Line on UPI payments. NPCI now needs to tie up with all big merchants, payment companies and payment gateways for Credit Line on UPI as well. It\u2019s a time-consuming job, and it will take decades for people to even understand this normal UPI and CC on UPI are separate networks, similar to the debit card and credit card networks",

Other credit cards are not charging fuel surcharge for Rupay-UPI transactions. See the HDFC screenshot I shared in a previous comment. Given the fee structure is not clear, they could have done a better job communicating it. But the Jupiter team wants to play defensive and act like I didn\u2019t read the fee structure clearly. Not a great way to treat feedback, in my opinion. I could have simply stopped using the card without saying a word. But I wanted to make the Jupiter team aware of a possibility of confusion. The response they had for me was little more than \u201cYou are wrong.\u201d If they don\u2019t want negative feedback, sure, they\u2019ll soon stop getting it",

So basically your jupiter account balance= Total Income -Total Spend(As per Money insight on jupiter) So my 2022 Total income amount is - 488496.24 Total spend - 479496.24 In 2023, total income -251219.26 Total Spend- 250219.26 So till now total income is 488496.24+251219.26=739715.5 Total spend is - 479496.24+250219.26=729715.5 So my jupiter balance will be 739715.5-729715.5=10000. But my current account balance is 1000. (Without FD, Pots balance) I checked calculation twice. All spends includes pot transfer and fixed deposit. So now my question is it is a bug in Jupiter or something like error? Or somehow i am wrong in calculation?

The balance text lacks the impact I was expecting\u2014it could have been bolder and larger to grab attention effectively. Moreover, there seems to be an excessive amount of whitespace around the balance amount which can be utilized better. Another issue I noticed is the placement of the search feature. It's positioned at the very top, which makes it quite inconvenient for single-handed use. If the intention is to encourage users to utilize the search functionality more frequently, it should be more easily accessible, ideally within reach of a single hand.  Hope these inputs/improvements will contribute to a more satisfying and user-friendly homepage experience. Adding \u2019s feedback here",

This way you will receive a part of your money with interest at 6.8% every month. if you increase the monthly amount significantly you can harvest the interest amount for splurging or a small treat.

        "text": "A bit about my Jupiter usage I started using Jupiter a year and a half ago. The sole reason I signed up for Jupiter was Pots. I was already keeping money aside for different purposes; Jupiter Pots gave convenient tooling for what I was doing. Jupiter Pots impressions Pots were great when I started. I liked them so much that I wrote a blog post praising them. While the rest of Jupiter has continued to improve and evolve, the Pots feature has stagnated mostly. There have been some changes, but they fall short of being good. For example, there is a Super Pots feature that lets you create fixed deposits using Pots. But on maturity, super pots will self-destruct, and the money will move to your saving account. That means Jupiter will put you at the risk of accidentally spending saved-up money on something unrelated! To me, that looks like a lazy implementation that doesn\u2019t stop to consider why the customer created a pot in the first place. Then they introduced Habits, which are essentially recurring deposits. Habits are buggy too; they move money from your saving account a day or two in advance. Reporting this issue to Jupiter hasn\u2019t really accomplished anything. But maybe that isn\u2019t surprising, given they don\u2019t even support updating communication address of bank accounts. (Not allowing address updates is a KYC norms violation, one would think?) Back to Pots being unloved. Even basic things like modifying pot names, rearranging pots in the UI, etc are not done even after so many months. Tells you how much they cares about Pots. Looking into the future The thing with convenience is that we are impressed by simple convenience initially. But over time, we take things for granted, and our needs evolve. We want more convenience. We expect our tools to do more for us. Same for me with Pots. I was able to overlook their flaws before, but now they are glaring. The Jupiter team not investing in Pots is understandable at the same time. Jupiter is a startup. Possibly a small team executing at their capacity to make their company a success by building features that people want to use. I am not surprised that no one outside a small niche cares about Pots. If Pots aren\u2019t bringing them customers or usage, calling Pots a failed experiment and exploring other ideas is the prudent thing to do for Jupiter, the startup. If Jupiter won\u2019t continue to be relevant for my needs, I suppose I should take care of them on my own. I already track my mutual fund savings using a spreadsheet. Making a similar tracker for bank account will be straightforward. Say, I close my Jupiter account and move all Pots to a tracker of my own. My primary bank provides auto-sweep fixed deposits, which means the money I hold as short term savings will earn a higher interest than the 3% Jupiter pays me. On top of all this, I\u2019ll be able to tweak the tooling as/when necessary. Such a flexibility is seldom available in a pre-packaged product. Looks like this is the end-of-the-road for Jupiter-and-me. Finally, Thank You to the Jupiter team for making Pots in the first place. Your product helped me see the convenience of separately labelled short-term savings. I may sever all my ties with Jupiter, but you have changed my life for the better. Thank you for that",

For a while we took a backseat on implementing new features on pots due to competing priorities, but we have been working on its holistic strategy around budgeting via pots. As you mentioned, how using pots has helped you with setting money aside, we would be doubling down on that use case and enhance its functionality. I would request you to stay tuned!

And here are some suggestions: Add option to check the total balance including the fund blocked for IPO or Retail Direct through UPI ASBA. Currently it only shows the Effective Balance (The balance I can spend). Show the amount in the foreign currency too for international transactions in transaction details. Currently it only shows the amount in INR. But you may wonder why would someone need it! Actually some service providers use it as verifying the identity if you get locked out of your account and loose access to the email, thet charge some random amount and ask to provide the value",

I think I need to clarify why we are not comfortable releasing half baked product. This is a product which consumer trusts to highest level in fintech by parking his/her money. So, if I as a consumer can\u2019t have access to my money or have issue in making transaction, I feel annoyed. I don\u2019t expect others to be forgiving with us. We have taken this concisous call that any product release has to meet basic quality checks in terms of security, reliability and usability. Else, we won\u2019t release. Few of community users already bashed us couple of times for facing bugs in live product. so we have become more cautious post that feedback and won\u2019t release any product which doesn\u2019t pass our quality checks. We are ok to face heat for delays but not ok for facing heat for quality issues. Hope you would appreciate the same. Also, pls have basic trust that we are more keen to scale and push products faster as it benefits Jupiter",

There were many complications and hurdles along the way, we apologize for the delay It's closer than ever! We are going to launch the feature soon. But first, we would like to test the flow with some community users who are interested in changing their Jupiter account mobile number. How is this going to work? You will need to register for the test here -  80-100 odd folks will be contacted for changing their mobile numbers. You will be invited for a quick phone call/Google Meet/Zoom call for 10-15 minutes with the Jupiter team. We can decide on a common time. Instructions will be given on the call, you will need to perform certain tasks for this to work. Note: Please opt for this only if you want to change your mobile number permanently. The number may/may not be changed. It\u2019s a simple test to see if this flow works. There won\u2019t be any side effects, don\u2019t worry. Excited to test the new flow with you folks! Can\u2019t wait",

It\u2019s been going on for a long time, and we apologize for the delay We are ramping up! We have started rolling out mobile number change in a phased manner and we should be at a 100% rollout by End of Week. How is this going to work? You will need to verify your identity through a small video saying out-loud the 4 digits displayed on the screen. Once verified, you\u2019ll have to enter the new mobile number and verify it by sending an authentication SMS. Once the SMS is verified with Federal Bank, you\u2019ll have to enter your MPIN and confirm the update. Thanks to all the folks who helped us test the flow",

Now, the matter is- I booked a fd of 30K in May 2023 in jupiter. At that time i only have idfc wow card so i thought to take a credit card against my deposit in federal bank as it will boost my credit score. So recently due to hospitalization of my grandmother we are facing some financial problems so i have to close my card so i proceed to close card, cleared all due, raised request to close the card and card closed today. Then i tried to break my deposit through jupiter but it\u2019s failed. Then 1st i contacted Federal Bank team as i used federal bank Signet Credit card so i called them and they said you have to cantact jupiter team but again i tried to convince the same person that i took card from federal bank, they marked lien so what is the role of Jupiter here ? They said no you have to contact jupiter team. Then i contacted jupiter team, explained all things then jupiter csa also agreed with me that if you used egde visa or egde rupay card then it\u2019s our matter but as it\u2019s federal bank card so it\u2019s lien marked by their end. Then i again contacted Federal Bank and explained all things happening they verified all details and they clearly said i can see your fd lien marked by jupiter team and mentioned reason is \u2018NA\u2019. Now i need help. I am not gonna use customer care number they will tell the same for sure or not gonna use help section. I am gonna visit federal bank branch Monday if the problem still exists. If the problem solved by jupiter team in mean time then no problem i am good. And if still exists then no option left rather than RBI ombudsman. And i have all the required call recordings of both side. If any jupiter member thinking the same that to get a secured card of federal bank using deposit booked through jupiter ( i think I\u2019ve seen some one who asking if it\u2019s possible to get federal bank secured card using jupiter fd earlier) please don\u2019t do it",

As there is a dedicated relationship manager, there is no need to go to the branch every-time and almost everything can be done online such as email as the RM personally knows you. Other perks include: A) Dedicated Priority Banking Debit Card with branding, with more rewards, lounge access, waived off fees and premium support. B) No need to stand in line as ordinary customers. Priority Banking members get to relax at the lounge when visiting banks in person. C) Preferential rates. Such as higher FD rates than normal customers and lower mortgage rates. D) WorldWide Recognition of Priority Banking Status with multinational banks. E) Pre-Approved Credit Card without need to show income. For me I got a pre-approved Credit Card with monthly limit of 3 lakhs. F) No fess during Cash Withdrawn at any ATM in India. Fees Waived. G) Forex Fees waived. Yes I reached out to the bank, to be specific my Relationship Manager, who handles everything, and forwards critical issues or requests to the dedicated team. He stays in touch and always provides me personalised support. I added him on WhatsApp and is quite convenient. What is different is the fact that, the bank personally knows you, VIP treatment by bank, and no need to wait in line etc at physical branches. The perks offered are also quite attractive. Bank Details of my Priority Banking Experience: Bank: Standard Chartered Bank India Limited This bank is in many countries and my membership in one extends to wherever I go. For example if I open an account with Standard Chartered Singapore, I am automatically enrolled in the Priority Banking service there, and get the perks specific to that region as well",

It worked fine but I observed it was very silent about it, no notification in the app or any banner regarding the same. The only way I came to know about it was from Email and SMS regarding transaction. So what I am suggesting is there should be a calendar view where we can see upcoming habits/ SIPs this will be very helpful to track them. Also some dismissible banner like ones of the bill payment to remind/ inform that the habit will deduct money in a day or two would also be helpful. To the community, How was you experience with habits/SIPs. Have you used it? Is it easy to manage multiple habits",

Also, investing a fixed amount every month helps you average your unit costs and manage risk from market movements. But why average your cost only 12 times a year, when you can do so 365 times a year with daily SIPs? Running out of money for your monthly SIPs? With daily & weekly SIPs, you can invest smaller amounts and maintain your investment discipline. For example, by investing Rs. 100 every day instead of Rs.3000 monthly, you can ensure that you invest at least a part of your investment, instead of missing out on your SIP entirely.

It\u2019s the fee structure! 0 joining fee is a good step but annual fee of 999rs is a big meh for most of the people who are used to lifetime free credit cards. The waiver option is a good move but 1.5L is not possible for many having more than 1 credit card. (Ps I have 8 plus and most of them are ltf!) So kindly look into this and rethink about the fee structure. The debit card fee thing has already damaged Jupiter\u2019s image in most minds but having pro makes it free card so something similar should be adopted for credit card. A ltf or lower annual fee will be a bang in the segment",

P2P mobile banking allows users to send and receive money directly from their mobile devices, usually using a linked bank account or mobile wallet. P2P mobile banking offers several benefits, such as the convenience of sending money instantly without the need for physical cash or checks. It is often used for activities like splitting bills, paying back friends or family, or making purchases from individuals. However, it\u2019s important to note that P2P mobile banking platforms may charge fees or impose limits on transaction amounts, so users should be aware of any associated costs before using these services. Here\u2019s how P2P mobile banking typically works: *Registration and Verification *Linking Bank Accounts *Initiating P2P Transactions *Authentication and Security *Transaction Processing *Confirmation While P2P banking offers convenience and ease of use, there are some security issues that users should be aware of",

I faced it with big players like Amazon. The auto debit feels like you taking money from your parents wallet without informing or telling them.(loss of trust) Recently on a payment platform I faced an error of payment on my Edge card. It was because my card was not allowing to set up Auto-Pay. Initially I was not happy with the payment experience but I shifted to Jupiter debit card and the payment went through but I got notified on SMS as well as on the app about a setup of autopay. This notification on my app literally made me aware about the dark pattern I just went through. And Jupiter also give me a direction how to tackle or manage this autopay set up in the app. I hope Jupiter notifies me a week before renewal so that I can then decide if I want to continue with the payment or not. Thanks for building this feature and proactively tackling the dark patterns",

While upstox chose to grow in an inorganical way, zerodha being a bootstrapped company always focused on improving themselves and put customer experience before anything else. Now Dhan is seriously catching upto them. While the traditional bank based brokers like Kotak securities started zero brokerage plans, they need to ramp up their infra compared to zerodha and dhan to catch upto them.

Correct me if it\u2019s not more options. Moving on to the transaction details on the home, you must be seeing random alphanumeric statements. We\u2019re planning to change this. For the Analysis part, This is a great representation. But this includes all the expenses, we might need to show incomes as well. So maybe a double tab? Things I\u2019ve learned from these designs. You as a user, Removed the \u201cDo more with Jupiter\u201d banners. I guess you found them annoying. Seems like they\u2019re in the way?

A tool that can give you quick access to the options that are not upfront. There can be a floating icon on the home screen (We can make it movable if needed - Reference Facebook Messenger chat bubble) Tapping on this, highlights the options and blurs the background. You will get 5 options when you click on it. The problem with this one is: It may look distracting to move it around. It may block and hover on some texts.

Particularly liked the detailing on several components like the icons, white spacing to give a clean minimal vibe & your understanding of the tradeoffs in a banking app - need to be minimal and clean + solve key user jobs. Love to share some of our Product philosophy and principles with respect to the Home Page. We use the User Jobs framework , to understand the most important jobs that need to be done , this highlights 5 top abstracted job themes Reduce time to view important financial information (account balance, recent transactions, other lines of business]) Reduce anxiety about critical activities that are in progress (tracking-related activities such as verification and card delivery, compulsory actions such as activating UPI, ordering cards, and SOS activities such as downtimes, failures) Increase awareness of necessary upcoming payments/activities (SIPs, SIs, Payment dues, UPI requests) Give users easy access to quick and consistent actions (Scan and Pay, Save money, Invest money) Enable easy discovery of relevant financial services offered by Jupiter Overtime we wish to be able to solve all these jobs, continuously looking to get better at solving them by learning more from our users. From a purely design perspective - Interesting to see that you put a \u2018+\u2019 sign , that opens up potentially to a list/view of different features/actions - this is something we are exploring. Love to learn more, if you can elaborate why you think this would be good for a user/how it would look. Scan & Pay - While some apps have it in a similar position as you suggested, we have got very strong user feedback that it should be bottom screen. Recent transactions - Nice. Any thoughts on a horizontal recent activity? Or more minimised/lesser entries to reduce scroll for lower sections. Look forward to keep hearing/seeing more Ranjeth",

My thoughts: Balance and quick icons If the balance and networth is on the left and the quick icons are on the right, it doesn\u2019t seem symmetrical. Y\u2019know what I mean? Think about right and left handed users. Right handed users might find this easier since the quick icons are on the right. Love the notification icons. Our team did have this idea. Sometimes, notifications do get lost and users forget what was sent. Bottom tab This tab looks visually better now. Love the idea for the raised QR code to show that it\u2019s more important (Feels like it\u2019s highlighted) Showing the profile pic instead of the hamburger button is a great idea! But not right now since it\u2019s just letters. Once this feature comes out, we should add it on the home page",

What is available right now on the History page? History of Transactions to a specific payee via Recent Payees as well as previously paid contacts Last Paid Amount and Date in Recent Payees, if there are any payees in the Recents section If this reminds you of Gpay, then yes, you\u2019re spot on! Many members and close connections liked how Gpay had a 1 page display for all the history of transactions for a payee. It was simple and easy to interact with. We wanted to bring that experience to you, with Jupiter Thoughts? If you\u2019ve used this on Gpay, drop your experience in the thread below and let us know what you think about the history page. Would you like to see something else? Something Gpay missed but wanted us to add? We\u2019re all ears! Stay tuned for more early updates. Happy Weekends",

If you haven\u2019t noticed it yet, we\u2019ve added: Scan1170\u00d72412 58.6 KB 1. Opening the scanner and keeping it ready Before: Open the scanner > black screen (0.5 seconds) > scanner page Now: Open the scanner > scanner page 2. Zoom You can 1x, 2x, and 3x the camera zoom while scanning the QR code. 3. Few button repositioning Before: View QR, Upload image, and flash icons used to be on the top right. Now: We\u2019ve moved them to the center. It\u2019s easier for our fingers to reach the center of the screen while using our phones in a 1 handed mode. 4. Less time used for scanning the code The scanner would take less time to read QR codes and take users to the confirmation screen. 5. Recent Payees at the bottom for quick access This is handy for users who pay frequently. 6. Design changes The scanner box has a spacefire tint Scan and pay the Jupiter way! Scan and Pay (QR) is one of the most used features on the Jupiter app. We\u2019ve prioritized this and heard some of our member\u2019s feedback. So here it is! This should be available to all users who are on app version 2.0.19 onwards. Try it out, Let us know if you feel the change",

Build a user stack with credit profile (not credit score)as Aggregators now have access to most financial transactions so they can leverage technology to prepare a personalised interest rate and credit risk (A fixed 12% interest thing just doesn\u2019t seem to work) A middle man(aggregator) who can take a shared risk for both lenders and borrowers which will essentially build trust in the system. Most users should not have a problem earning a 10% interest or 8% interest if the risk is shared by some common aggregator. To build a massive P2P stack we will need to invest in basket type credit lines rather than giving loans to direct users eg: home loans for people with avg salary of 25LPA, bike loans/car loans for users with credit score 800+, businesses with annual revenue 1cr etc. Building baskets will minimize risk and default rate",

        "text": "The Indian Premier League (IPL) was first introduced in 2008, which means that it is now 16 years old. In that time, the league has grown from strength to strength, attracting some of the biggest names in cricket and establishing itself as one of the most lucrative and popular leagues in the world. With a format that combines sport and entertainment, the IPL has captured the imaginations of millions of fans across the globe and helped to popularize the sport of cricket even further. From thrilling matches to star-studded lineups, the IPL has something for everyone, and its popularity shows no signs of slowing down any time soon. While the Indian Premier League (IPL) is primarily a sporting event, it has also become an important platform for fintech companies to showcase their products and services. With millions of fans tuning in to watch the matches, the IPL offers a unique opportunity for fintech companies to reach a massive audience and increase their brand visibility. Several fintech companies have already partnered with IPL teams and the league itself to promote their services. For example, Paytm, one of India\u2019s leading digital payment platforms, has been a title sponsor of the IPL in the past and has also partnered with various IPL teams to offer exclusive discounts and cashback offers to fans. Similarly, Dream11, a fantasy sports platform, has become an official partner of the IPL and has seen tremendous growth in its user base during the league. Fintech has a significant presence in the IPL. In the 2022 edition of the tournament, 29 start-ups joined the 10 IPL teams, with fintech companies being the top contributors, representing 34.5% of all participating start-ups. While the number of start-ups participating in the IPL has decreased to 19 in 2023 from 29 last year, fintech start-ups continue to lead the way in terms of sponsorship with 31.6% (Source: Inc42). Just like in the previous year, fintech companies are taking advantage of IPL\u2019s massive audience to promote their products and services. Overall, the IPL has become an important platform for fintech companies to tap into the huge Indian market and offer their innovative solutions to millions of cricket fans across the country. As the league continues to grow in popularity, we can expect to see more and more fintech companies leveraging the power of the IPL to reach new customers and expand their businesses (Hope the decrease in this year\u2019s sponsorship is only a short-term phenomenon). 2022 report:  2023 Article:  The 16th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 began on March 31, 2023, and will conclude on May 28, 2023. It seems like the only entity that isn\u2019t paying attention to the IPL carnival is Team Jupiter . Whether you browse Flipkart, MobiKwik, or any other app, you\u2019ll come across some form of IPL-related promotions, rebranding, prediction contests, and offers. However, there\u2019s been no such news or activity on the Jupiter App or in the community forum. Is there, not a single cricket enthusiast working at Jupiter?  Is the cost of sponsorship a significant hindrance? (I am not aware of the exact cost of Jersey sponsorships, although I know that a 10-second ad during the IPL costs millions). Are there any future sponsorship plans for Jupiter, such as sponsoring the Royal Challengers Bangalore team? Whenever I see the orange cap during IPL, I instantly associate it with Jupiter due to its distinctive colour. It\u2019s worth considering the value that IPL sponsorship can bring to a company. With a vast viewership and audience engagement, IPL sponsorship can be a great way to increase brand awareness and reach out to potential customers. Perhaps it\u2019s time for Jupiter to explore the possibilities of IPL sponsorship and capitalize on the potential benefits it can bring. Which is your favourite IPL team? Chennai Super Kings (CSK) Delhi Capitals (DC) Gujarat Titans (GT) Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) Mumbai Indians (MI) Punjab Kings (PBKS) Rajasthan Royals (RR) Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) 20 voters Results",

I am still curious about the reasons behind the launch of the Tata Neu app by the TATA group. In contrast, I believe that Ather gained its significant presence through its IPL advertisements and sponsorship of the Gujarat Titans. These two factors played a vital role in making the brand popular in our region. Also, I can see CSK and RCB leading the polls here",

Last night, I found myself supporting the Gujarat Titans, believe it or not! The main reason behind this choice was the attitude of many CSK fans around here in my locality. I can\u2019t quite figure out why, but they always attribute the team\u2019s success to just one person (you know who I mean! ). Even when Jadeja achieves the impossible, I rarely see anyone giving him the credit he deserves, here in my village. Before the start of the season, I had a strong feeling that CSK would lift the trophy, much like Argentina did for Messi when they said he would retire after the World Cup. I strongly felt that the same thing would happen for CSK, and whenever someone asks the captain if he plans to retire after the season, the answer would be a resounding \u201cDefinitely not!\u201d  Sir, you have to be a MI fan ? right? Anyway lets wait and see next season",

I checked federal bank branch in kochi and tried many branches but none matches my Jupiter IFSC\u2026 Atlast i gave my Niyox branch details to complete the procedure (First time that i ever touched niyox) I contact flipkart\u2019s customer care and they told me to add another account and they cant do anything much. Any workaround for this problem? Flipkart doesnt recognise jupiter as a bank",

I mentioned a couple times that I don\u2019t see any reference number starting with \u2018S\u2019 for any UPI transactions but still I was being forced to check. Finally the executive checked via date/amount and confirmed there was no reference number starting with \u2018S\u2019 Then she started arguing that I provided the wrong Ref Num when all that time she did not scroll up to go till the chat where I provided the reference number and she was cross checking with the Jupiter transaction id I provided after reference number. I expected a better customer support from Jupiter. But I guess the quality will keep dropping as Jupiter grows bigger. I just really hope that it doesn\u2019t as Customer Support is one of the key factors when choosing a bank, specially a NEO bank.

It\u2019s good that you are looking out for Jupiter but that does not mean anyone who puts up a complaint or feedback is trying to point out all negatives and is totally against Jupiter. If you like something you want it to be good! Especially when it has been good earlier. This seems like you are trying to start a debate on POSITIVES and NEGATIVES of Jupiter. Like you mentioned, anyone can share their experiences which is precisely what I am trying to do. Also, I am quite sure if someone mentioned something POSITIVE about Jupiter, you wouldn\u2019t have mentioned that one should consider NEGATIVE aspects, as well. By the way, the COMMUNITY FORUM is not the only Positive thing about Jupiter. This is not meant to offend you or anyone but these kind of lines: \u2018I completely understand your situation and the inconvenience it has caused for you.\u2019 is like a trigger. Most customer executives copy paste something related when they clearly don\u2019t mean that. This happened with me and Jupiter support too! Anyways thanks and again no offense meant",

One that I would love to have is a wide networth Bar with a Aggregate Overview displayed. The app already has a networth indicator inside the it in the \u201cMoney Tab => Networth\u201d section If it was possible to have a financial overview dashboard widget, it would be amazing. And the app also has Multiple Bank Account Linking feature that shows all balances together. Even a simple 3\u00d73 Table of [ Net Worth ] [ Received | Spend | Invested ] [ Accounts (s)Balance | Asset | Liability ] would be amazing. I can see how some people would not want to show actual financial numbers openly, so it could also have a option to disable Money Value and just have bars, graphs and arrows to indicate them. Even other stuff but I really think some better widgets could be great",

Till now i know that the consumer name is the owner of electricity meter. But according to Jupiter\u2019s support team ( as per conversation between me and them over call) the consumer name will be payee name, means if shawn pays my electricity bill through jupiter app so the consumer will be shawn pinto, if Mr. X pays my bill through jupiter consumer name will be Mr. X. And she said my bill payment is completed successfully. So here is the proof that my bill payment is not completed - Screenshot_2023-05-30-18-20-22-00_49b96b5fbae0d12a18edc4a3afe0dfd91080\u00d72400 175 KB Screenshot_2023-05-30-18-43-10-28_40deb401b9ffe8e1df2f1cc5ba480b121080\u00d72400 214 KB IMG_20230530_1842061080\u00d72400 156 KB Screenshot from gpay, paytm and WBSEDCL website, if you look consumer name is SAMIR GHOSH(Actual name).

In previous Mobiquik , Paytm, cred , icici bank imoney, axis etc. asked me for email access permissions for categorised details of my spending and credit. I don\u2019t give them due to security issues, they also asked for DOB, full name, pan card number, registered mobile number ( they also have in their system during kyc or registration) for unlock password protected PDF ( statement) . Even I also don\u2019t give my primary email id to NiyoX and Fi money , they need gmail access to login their app. Many Bank and payment system still send OTP in email or email access and verify link to email, if it in unauthorised hand their will be issue. If it\u2019s data fatched the data from SMS, credit bureaus, tokenization saved card details, financial aggregator then it\u2019s will be ok , my mobile give permission or allow to read SMS when only I\u2019m using the app. And it\u2019s only trusted banking app not to 3rd party payment app or any others app or Truecaller. Those app setted to no background running and background data permission. But this feature is cool and smart, people don\u2019t have to time for accounting their spending.

How do you go about it solving right now? - For domestic use ,other payment apps where they provide option to edit upi id. If a upi id can be attached to a specific pot account ,it will be a greatly useful feature . Regards Rahul",

I got a credit card through my salary account in HDFC because SBI didn\u2019t even take my application as I didn\u2019t have a credit score. So HDFC considered that I didn\u2019t have a credit score but I have a 2 years relationship with them. So I got a credit card and built my credit score and then got the SBI card. I would recommend you to get a secured credit card by depositing a FD. Using that secured card, you can build your credit score. Then you can get any credit card you want. Hope it helps\u2026 And as for automated systems, Jupiter is a new entrant and the fact is they can\u2019t directly compete with the goliaths like HDFC, ICICI or for that matter even Federal Bank. So the costs could be kept minimal through automated systems. Hope you can understand that",

We have started showing Personalised Nudges on the Money Tab, across spend, save and invest behaviours. These nudges are dependent on customer info, hence not all nudges will be visible to all customers. The plan here is to bring more relevant insights & improve the serving of these nudges in the coming weeks. Do check them out and share your feedback on both aspects. We can also connect 1-on-1 if you have more details to share. Community-spotlight834\u00d7834 112 KB Thanks",

In short, Re-KYC / KYC update is a mandate from the bank as and when requested by the Bank (Federal in our case). Failure to complete the KYC update within the stipulated time can result in blocking of account by the Bank. Steps to update KYC online - (Active Debit Card is mandatory to proceed with this process online) Log in to  Enter your Bank Account Number You will receive an OTP on your registered mobile number There is a captcha post the above step Select KYC upload as the option and follow the next steps of uploading Address and Identify proof. Please note that the uploaded file size does not cross 2 MB. If you receive any error or do not have an active Debit Card associated with the Savings Bank Account, the only way to get the Re-KYC / KYC update done is by visiting the nearest Federal Bank. KYC as a process is under Bank\u2019s jurisdiction and hence, all things related with KYC will be maintained and processed at the Bank\u2019s end only as per the guidelines from the Regulator",

        "text": "Have been using Jupiter for iOS for a few days. Apart from the mobile verification hiccups, once I logged in, everything was smooth. App opening is quick. The first UPI payment failed. So I kind of went sceptical about the payment success rate and shifted to Paytm for a while. However, I didn\u2019t face any payment issues later. The app on iOS feels more stable than android. None of my rewards were blocked too. However had some minor issues that I observed. App notifications are not yet present. I still get a text message for money deposit or debit messages even though I have enabled app notifications. UPI payment requests should be notified via app notifications rather than a text message. When logging into the app, the account balance should be set visible by default. It\u2019s an extra step to see how much money is present in the account. While making a payment, users should also have an option to add a footnote to certain payments. For example, one of a food joint in my area is registered as \u201cSM Enterprises\u201d so it would be confusing while tallying what this place actually was. Some payments made from third party apps are often displayed as PAYOUT/383910303/\u2026 which is confusing and so an additional footnote would make sense. Reward promos should strictly stay in the Reward section of the app. I see it creeping around in the Home section of the app, which is not bad per se. But very much out of context. It would be more streamlined if all the offers strictly remain the rewards section of the app. I hope to see new features added like bill payments and UPI mandates. But I have heard that these are currently being built and so for what the product is right now, it\u2019s minimal and very much functional. Very positive experience",

It appears that our debit cards have a minimum expiry date of 2026 (that\u2019s why none have experienced this situation before). I think they would be automatically renewed by Jupiter around the expiry date or perhaps a month prior, similar to how regular banks handle it",

ICICI and HDFC had good shots with the likes of Pockets/Mine and PayZapp respectively. But they messed up big time. HDFC Salary account (zero charges, endless capabilities) + neat and modern mobile banking application. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the challenge for them to pursue this.

And there is an endless list of things which I can do with my traditional bank\u2019s mobile application which neobanks can\u2019t (they might have those in future). Neobanks are far far away from setting a trend. I cannot emphasise it more, even neobanks cannot survive \u201czero-charges\u201d banking offerings. They might be low-cost, yes but not zero cost. They will have to come the traditional banking route if they want to make money. And when this happens, when neobanks have to adopt the traditional banking schemes of making money - it is just the stability and usability of their digital offerings that is going to matter. Because in banking offerings, they cannot compete with the too-big-to-fail banks. So yes, I stick to my point that a Federal bank CDM is a threat to Jupiter",

There\u2019s no assurance that a user will receive a higher or the same loan amount after closing (even pre-closure) their existing loan. The outcome depends on multiple factors, such as their current credit score, creditworthiness, active loan accounts, credit utilization, a high number of loan inquiries, numerous other financial obligations, and more. Additionally, there is also a possibility that a user may be denied a new loan after closing their existing one. It\u2019s important to note that the loan amount is not determined by Jupiter itself but rather by their lending partner",

This is something that we had considered while building the FD product on Jupiter, but decided to go ahead with interest payment on maturity as the only option. The reason for this was that our user research at the time indicated that our young users prefer to compound their interest, rather than receive a periodic payout. We\u2019ll revisit this in our future improvements",

I got in touch with customer support and after a few discussions, they got to know the issue. The phone number I used for onboarding was associated with a different customer\u2019s account in their system. And due to company policy, they\u2019re unable to delete or modify this data from their database. I recently got a new phone number and linked it with my Aadhaar & PAN. I also have a federal account with this new number. But I cannot for some reason create a Jupiter account because some X customer had used my new number previously. Now I cannot onboard Jupiter because of the said issue. The customer support says I can onboard if I get a new sim and gets it linked to my Aadhaar/PAN and that\u2019s a long, hectic process which I do not want to go through. Please allow users to create an account with any number as long as it\u2019s linked with their Aadhar and PAN. Follow the same while they change their number. This is a very lame issue and we should fix it. Any help is welcome",

Earlier Jupiter had a BNPL product similar to PAYTM Postpaid, and it was called JUPITER EDGE (its former name was BULLET). The user got a pre-approved credit limit and the same can be utilized for bill payments or recharges and can be repaid after 15 days. But unfortunately, the services were closed to RBI regulations related to BNPL services. As  sir said, at present, salary account holders get a feature called \u201cOn-demand salary\u201d whereby he/she can get an early salary on whichever date they desire to withdraw that money. Also, since, Jupiter is planning to introduce a co-branded credit card shortly, I hope that you will have the opportunity to acquire a credit limit associated with it. This credit limit can be utilized for recharges, bill payments, and subsequently repaid at a later date",

To answer the question asked in the post, I\u2019m waiting to accumulate enough of their so-called Jewels, so I can redeem them and close the credit card. And then wait until 6 months to close their useless bank account. They created a big drama about Rupay credit card, with waiting list, etc. and 5% cashback on Rupay CC with UPI. For the first few transactions, there was 5% cashback, then suddenly it was down to 0.4%. Rupay CC with UPI is hardly accepted by anyone. While this is not Jupiter\u2019s fault, they conveniently forgot to mention this while peddling their product. The Jewels can be redeemed only to a Jupiter account, or else you can get \u201cvouchers\u201d (for which you need thousands of jewels) or you can buy digital gold (paying GST, of course), and then good luck figuring out how to sell that digital gold. Why exactly do the jewels need to be redeemed in multiples of 100? You are aware of fractions, as seen in the whopping 0.4% cashback, then why can\u2019t you let us redeem jewels not in multiples of 100",

What is the Edge CSB Bank Rupay Credit Card? The Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card is a credit card issued by CSB Bank, exclusively available on the Jupiter app. It combines the advantages of UPI payments with traditional credit card features, allowing you to make UPI transactions using your credit card. 2. How can I apply for the card? You can apply for the Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card by visiting the Jupiter app. Currently, the card offer is open only to existing Jupiter app holders and onboarded on at least one of our existing products. We will soon launch for customers outside of Jupiter in a few weeks. 3. Can non-Jupiter account holders apply for the Edge CSB Bank Rupay Credit Card? The Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card is not exclusive to Jupiter savings account holders. It\u2019s available to a broader audience. You will have to wait a few weeks to onboard, however. 4. How do I check my eligibility for the card? What is the eligibility criteria? Eligibility criteria are based on factors like age, income, credit score, and other financial indicators. To check your eligibility, refer to the information provided on the Jupiter app or website. 5. Is it better to join the waitlist from the app or website? Which one will increase my chances of getting the Card? Joining the waitlist from either the app or the website offer similar chances of getting the card. Use the platform you are most comfortable with for a seamless application process. 6. How to jump the waitlist queue? We are rolling out to eligible users in the waitlist. The team is working on a referral model. Stay tuned! 7. I joined the waitlist but have not heard back, what am I supposed to do? If you joined the waitlist and haven\u2019t received any updates or communication, it is advisable to keep using the Jupiter application as normal, as we are going into a phased rollout for the card. 8. What is the process of applying for the card? The application process typically involves providing personal and financial information. Keep your Aadhaar number handy, along with your PAN card and other important information\u2026 Follow the specific instructions provided on the Jupiter app or website. 9. What is the difference between Edge Visa and Edge Rupay credit cards? The main difference between the Edge Visa Credit Card (Issued by Federal Bank) and Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Cards is the card network they are associated with. Edge Visa is associated with the Visa network, while Edge Rupay is linked to the RuPay network. Each has different benefits and acceptance based on their respective networks and issuing bank. Screenshot 2023-10-23 at 4.58.08 PM1434\u00d7898 144 KB More info for each of these: Edge Federal Bank Visa Credit Card Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card 10. If I already have the Edge Visa Credit Card, can I get the Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card? No, you won\u2019t be able to get the RuPay variant if you have the Edge Visa Credit Card. As excited as we are to be able to extend the Edge Rupay credit card to you, currently, we will not be able to offer the Edge CSB Bank RuPay credit card to you as you have already availed the Edge Federal Bank VISA credit card. We wouldn\u2019t recommend you to cancel the Edge Credit Card as the cancellation will not help in increasing the chances of being eligible for the Edge RuPay Card. Rest assured, we are working hard to extend access to the Edge RuPay credit card to all our users and you\u2019ll be notified via the Jupiter app when you are eligible for it. 11. What\u2019s the story behind the transparent card design? Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card is backed by a credit card network called RuPay - which is India\u2019s own version of Visa/ MasterCard. One of the benefits of the Rupay Card is to link the card to UPI and transact, the same way we do on our bank accounts. We thought - why not try and showcase this \u201cduality\u201d of the card in a single-split design, which brings together the \u201ctransparency\u201d of UPI with the Jupiter branding of spacefire. A transparent card represents some of the customer-centric values we hold dear at Jupiter \u2014transparency and responsibility. With the linking of credit cards to the UPI network, we\u2019re excited to bring you a symbol of our commitment to fintech innovation in India. 12. I joined the waitlist for the RuPay Credit Card, but now I am not seeing it in the app. What should I do? If you\u2019ve joined the waitlist but no longer see it in the app, consider reaching out to the Jupiter\u2019s customer support team for assistance and clarification regarding your application status. 13. How will the cashback be given to me? The jewels earned on Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card are redeemable to cash, gold, or gift cards 15 days after they are earned. This will be credited to the Federal Bank account linked with Jupiter. Conclusion: As we work on our product offerings, we\u2019d like to inform our Community about the revamps and early updates. Please share your feedback so we can collaborate together. We plan to roll out the Edge CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card to our close friends, team members, and a few sets of users first.

        "text": "Uske pichhe bhi kuchh reasons he. Unsecured Credit Card is considered as an Unsecured Loan for Banks and they don\u2019t have any collateral available (e.g. FD, RD, Insurance etc.) for recovering their unpaid amount & dues. If the Card Holder dies then Bank can\u2019t recover their pending amount from his/her heirs or by selling properties. So, Banks try to reduce their risk by issuing new variants to the same customer with combined limit of their 1st card. It means that they haven\u2019t increased their risk yet increased their revenue pool coming from additional variants. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are following this Combined Limit Strategy for Card Upgrade Request from existing Customers. e.g. If Customer is holding ICICI Bank\u2019s Coral Card with Credit Limit of \u20b91,00,000 and request for Card Upgrade to MMT Platinum Variant via Mobile App/IVR, then new card will be issued with Combined Limit of Coral. While SBI Card is following Limit Division Strategy, where Limit of 1st Card is reduced up to the extent, customer wishes to, and transferred to Upgraded Card Variant. e.g. If Customer is holding SBI Card\u2019s SimplyCLICK with Credit Limit of \u20b91,00,000 and request for Card Upgrade to Prime Variant via Mobile App/IVR, then customer will be asked to shift his/her Existing Limit to new card. So if customer wishes to transfer the limit of \u20b930,000 from SimplyCLICK then Prime will be issued with \u20b930,000 while Limit of SimplyCLICK will be updated to 70,000. This also works vice versa, means if customer is holding 2 different variants and wishes to close any of them then limit of that card can be transferred to remaining one, before closure. But I have heard that now SBI Card has stopped this Limit Merging facility. Not sure about this. Now, the important question is which benefits are available to Customers in such Cases. (1) No Full KYC for Card Upgrade (2) No Income Documents will be required for Card Upgrade (3) Sure shot and faster Card Approval compared to General Application (4) Features and Benefits of using another Variant (Rewards Points / Cashback etc. & Discounts) But if customer chooses to apply separately for another variant, then in such a case s/he has to follow general application process and there are chances of both approval and rejection in this case. Because if Bank found the customer credit worthy and wishes to take additional risk then card will be approved otherwise rejected. But if card is approved then there will be Separate Limit on the issued variant from the existing one",

I wonder if it\u2019s a typo and should actually be valid until May 2023, or if it\u2019s a bug showing an expired offer. I checked my wife\u2019s and my brother\u2019s accounts, and the validity is the same there as well. image739\u00d71600 123 KB image421\u00d7805 69.3 KB",

This is good to personalise stock options for beginners or to get user behaviour data. Landed on the stocks tab, love the minimal design and really liked how  was able to keep it just like our current investments tab. The UI looks very similar when we scroll through our MF, FD\u2019s etc. Stock space is interesting. +10000 to this idea If those are conversations that lead to our Community, that would be the best. Loved the news concepts too. Helps keeps us in check. This whole tab would make me come to the app everyday, just to read the news, suggestions and Q&A (if relatable) and check status of my stock.

May be you made our life a little easier whenever we build one! Apart from detailed feedback already from  , few standouts for me: How you have gone to cover entire user journey. Starting from discovery, collecting user data, giving recommendation and buy stock/set a SIP flow. Closely adhering to existing investment UI elements to ensure consistency between similar offering. A fully functional prototype is cherry on the cake Giving social channel for users to discuss stocks, get more confidence towards investing Giving multiple ways to explore, recommendation, interest, basis trends, etc How Risk vs returns is foundation for entire experience. be it on stock page, watchlist, etc Some feedback from my experience of designing a couple of investing products here: Bringing in more cues to excite user to pick one over the other investment option basis their preference. Returns is one such strong hook Stocks is exciting choice among available investment methods but also often associated with fear of losing money. How can we establish trust with stocks through markers, education to help user become more confident, etc Stocks can be intimidating for a lot of early starters. How we make our users confident by explaining industry jargons is also something worth exploring You can use green/red color to help user easily identify stocks with growth and fall Compare stocks within the category for better selection And just some more\u2026 but we will save it for our conversation. Really appreciate the amount of effort you have put into this. My teammates at Jupiter are very excited to learn your design journey with this project and how we can also help you make it better through some insights that we have",

I hope everyone enjoyed their long weekend Just wanted to let you know that we\u2019re in the process of revamping the Money tab The PFM team at Jupiter has been working hard on an all-new and improved Money tab, aimed at increasing awareness about your money movement. We would like to share some sneak peeks & early updates and get your early feedback before launching to a larger audience. What\u2019s new? All Bank Balances Movement: Building on the total bank balance, the balance\u2019s trendline shows how your money is moving across Jupiter and AA-linked accounts. Cashflow aka Month so far: The cashflow widget shows, at a glance, your incoming, spent, saved, invested, and remaining - so that you can stay true to your personal finance goals (more to launch on this in the near future). Month over month trends: Building on the spend categorization (It\u2019s more intuitive), now you can see monthly patterns for your running spends, savings, and investments, as well as spend categories, e.g. Food & Drinks, Bills & Utilities. \u2018Remaining\u2019 pattern: With Remaining, you can see how much you\u2019re left with each month. Put that idle cash to work.

You can now reconcile your balance movement alongside expenses Networth, which is more long-term money movement, has been separated from a more volatile view of your money i.e \u201cMonthly Cash Flow\u201d Loan Tracking issues have been fixed Let\u2019s test this together If you want to get more out of these new upgrades, you will need to categorize your transactions. Answer some questions: Since you saw the sneak peeks, did you understand what it can be used for? Share what you understood from the images above, we need to understand how you perceive the new updates. Would something like this be useful to you? This is aimed to go live very, very soon! We\u2019ll update the thread once it\u2019s available to be taken for a spin! P.S. - Some of the flows, imagery, and text are still undergoing improvements - we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll love the final flow when it\u2019s ready but do share your initial thoughts about the feature and what more would you want to see in here! Have a nice weekend everyone",

I see that normal savings account does not have any forex markup fee waiver, but even Pro accounts have a waiver only up to INR 1 Lac per month. When you\u2019re in a foreign land for 3 months or more, the expenses can go up real quick. Even Fi (which has same banking partner as Jupiter) offers no-limit zero forex charges. Could we see that in Jupiter too, someday? Zero forex is important to students studying abroad, and capping it to just 25000 or even 1 lac is NOT sufficient measure towards forex free. If Jupiter has same banking partner as Fi, why is it unnecessarily giving advantage of competition to its competitor? Moreover, the older 5% cashback on international transactions has also stopped. Isn\u2019t is a completely lose-lose situation now",

I may not know your business but I am a student studying abroad and very well know how quickly that 3.5% adds up. And honestly, I don\u2019t think that other businesses that do implement uncapped zero forex are \u201cmaking losses\u201d in this segment. VISA is getting very popular for charging the lowest currency interchange fee as well as MDR, and there are tons on banks here in the Emirates, especially neobanks that implement the zero forex condition too. In India, from whatever I know, Fi Money, Niyo Global and NiyoX are similar neobanks that offer uncapped zero forex. Now at this point you may ask me to leave and use their services, and to be very honest, I\u2019m doing that. I just tried Jupiter for the sake of trying the VISA Signature card that it offers (just like Niyo Global), but at this level, I don\u2019t see any difference in the services offered. I saw older blogs when Jupiter used to offer 5% international cashbacks while implementing standard forex markup charges, which might be a good thing, but as of now, removing that benefit and implementing capped markup waiver (and that too, on a very low end of 25k for a Pro account, which is way too low). You may consider studying the average international expenditure of a student, that has the lowest expense and you may not even call it a waiver anyway So maybe, instead of blaming me, you may start seeing what\u2019s happening around you. And a tip: Possibly banning me after seeing this comment won\u2019t get you anywhere\u2026 I\u2019m already leaving this platform for good, soon\u2026 This community had some nice people too, one of them helped me in onboarding when I got stuck, many thanks and loads of respect to them",

Community spotlight cards1920\u00d71920 69.3 KB What is it? So every time you spend, you can invest \u20b910 or more in a Mutual Fund. It\u2019s fully automatic and works in the background, while you go about spending as usual. For example, if you spend \u20b9500 on Swiggy, a minimum of \u20b910 goes to a Mutual fund of your choice. And you can set a monthly upper limit to be invested. That means if you want, you can invest only up to \u20b91500 in a month. We have a separate thread for this feature. Click on this link here to access the thread - (New feature) You can now invest as you pay! \ud83d\ude4c 2. Early access for invest as you pay!

Oh and, we\u2019ve revamped a few icons on the home page. To make it fit our vibe IMG_28951170\u00d7395 20.6 KB Here\u2019s the older look: IMG_18911170\u00d72532 143 KB Spot the difference! 4. Something new? Screenshot 2024-02-27 at 3.11.27 PM1920\u00d71440 35.1 KB Screenshot 2024-02-27 at 3.11.15 PM1920\u00d71423 27.1 KB Any idea what\u2019s coming?

When funds are deducted from your primary account as part of the autopay setup, you receive a debit receipt to confirm the transaction. Subsequently, when the same amount is successfully deposited into your super pot, a credit receipt is generated to acknowledge the completion of the transaction. We appreciate your feedback, and we are actively working on enhancing our notification system to make it more intuitive for our users. Your understanding is highly valued, and we apologize for any confusion caused. Thank you",

        "text": "Hey, So today I was at INOX and realized that I had left my Jupiter card at home. I asked them if I could UPI but they refused and told me that they don\u2019t accept it. (Ended up paying with a credit card sigh) So it got me thinking. What about making it so we can pay with our cards through NFC directly via the Jupiter app or add it onto apps like Samsung Pay or Google pay? And still get cashback or not, Cashback doesn\u2019t matter to me atleast. image696\u00d7392 46.4 KB FAQ Why not pay via UPI? My response: Some stores don\u2019t accept it. (Especially here in Kolkata) Go back and bring our card? My response: Some times we may forget or loose them and especially when you are in a situation where you are purchasing food or clothes and realize that you cannot go back and bring them/ or wait for a new card to come. And since I\u2019m travelling I cant even get a card, since I\u2019m not home. We carry our phones all the time, but not our wallets. Use Cash? My response: If we don\u2019t have our cards, we cannot withdraw cash. How does this work? My response: It is the same technology on our cards called NFC. It comes on all modern phones now a days. Safety-ness of this? My response: I guess this one matters on you, Jupiter allows us to turn on/off Contactless payments so maybe use that as a safeguard? Anyways there is a lock on financial apps like Jupiter/Gpay/Samsung pay so its pretty safe and Gpay even makes a different card number so your number is never leaked. (test it out, it works), Much safer than a card that just requires a tap to make payments without any pin. How many banks have these? My response: Many have it, like kotak, axis, icici, Federal bank (only on the Gpay app) and so on\u2026 Even OneCard the co-branded credit card has it (Gpay). You said Federal Bank is supported on Gpay so why cant we use our Jupiter cards on it? My response: Only certain Bins are given to Gpay by Federal Bank and Jupiter\u2019s bin is not on it that is why. (what is a bin? Bank Identification Number (Bin) is the first 4-6 numbers on a payment card that identifies the card issuer. The first digit is the major industry identifier, and the remaining digits communicate the financial institution that issued the card.) (What is your bin? Check it here  Reply with a question and ill reply. This whole thing is a petition/suggestion btw. Forgive any mistakes in my post. The Jupiter Iphone app image is just for illustration on how I want to see the app, I havent put much effort into it. Untitled design (4)1587\u00d72245 211 KB",

        "text": "In April 2023, I received a message on WhatsApp from someone offering an online job promoting e-commerce product reviews. They asked me to buy the products and review them, promising that the product amount and a commission would be added to my account. They continued to add high-value products, and during that time, I was not thinking clearly and ended up giving around \u20b9615,800. They then increased the product value to \u20b91.3 million and asked me to complete the task to withdraw the money, which I couldn\u2019t do. The scammers used the name of a known e-commerce company, OnBuy (an England-based company), to deceive people. When I realized I had been scammed, I immediately contacted the OnBuy social media team, who confirmed that it was a fake website and assured me they would report it. Without informing the scammers that I was aware of the scam, I immediately filed a complaint with my bank and the cybercrime department and also visited my bank branch. The bank\u2019s assistant manager confirmed that the scammers\u2019 accounts were frozen and that the money was still there. Despite this, I received no positive response from the bank for a chargeback. I escalated the matter to the RBI, but their team showed little interest in resolving the issue and focused only on closing the ticket. I have emailed the bank\u2019s CEO, but their senior management keeps telling me to follow up with the cybercrime team and that they will only proceed once they receive an update from them. Since then, I have been continuously following up with the cybercrime team, but the person handling my case often claims to be busy and is now not even responding. The RBI states that any scam reported to the bank within 24-48 hours will result in a refund, but I believe this is false because no one is helping, and I am still paying EMIs on the amount I borrowed. I don\u2019t know how or when I will get my money back. If anyone knows a way to resolve this, please suggest a solution that does not require any additional money, as I have exhausted all my savings. I live with my parents in a rented house, and my salary is not sufficient. I am in a very bad situation right now",

Now if I make a transaction of Rs.15,000/-, the insufficient balance of Rs.8,000/- which is not in Savings account will be withdrawn from the linked FD. In the same way, Jupiter can allow to link their POTS to the Savings account and whenever we are making a bill payment, providing an option to pay bills from the saved POT will make the process smoother. Because, we create POTS for quarterly/half-yearly/annual payments every month. And when the due date comes, we have to break the POT manually and make the payments. Instead if such feature where we can make the payment from POTS is provided, it would be too good. I know POTS create a Virtual RD with the partner bank and direct payment is not possible. But you can always route it through Savings account instead of manually going to respective POT and breaking such POT and then make the payment.

So I am curious as to how one can lose his/her mobile number permanently. One reason that I can think of is when the SIM card is not in your name and the owner is not accessible to you.

A New Fund Offering (NFO) is like an IPO in the stock market, but for Mutual Funds. Investors can purchase units of a Mutual Fund as soon as it launches. With an NFO, you can invest in a fund at its inception, getting early access to a promising investment. Why Invest in NFOs? Early Access: NFO allows you to invest in a fund at its launch price, which can be beneficial if the fund performs well over time. Diverse Opportunities: NFOs often introduce innovative strategies, sectors, or themes that might not be available through existing funds, giving you access to fresh and diverse investment opportunities. Potential for High Returns: While all investments come with risks, NFOs can deliver substantial returns, especially if the fund manager can capitalize on market trends and opportunities. Strategic Investment: NFOs can complement your existing portfolio by adding exposure to new sectors or strategies, helping you to diversify and manage risk more effectively.

I tried downloading the PDF statement. Here are some observations - As soon the statement gets downloaded, the document opens automatically. I understand this flow could have been set up from ease of use perspective so that the user does not need to look for the statement in downloads, it can stump a few users. When I came back to the Jupiter app, I wanted to generate another statement and hence I choose the on screen \u201cx\u201d button. Instead of taking me to the screen to pick a new statement period, the statement page closed. Is this how it is supposed to work? For excel based statement, the app states that the statement cannot be requested on email. Ideally, someone would request for the excel based statement to check them on their laptop or desktop. Checking it in a mobile device may not be as helpful",

Everything would have been fine if that amount had been credited to my account, but unfortunately, it hasn\u2019t. It\u2019s not even recorded in the account transactions; the statement indicating the withdrawal is only in my pots statement, and it doesn\u2019t appear in the account statement or the Federal bank statement either. The frustration doesn\u2019t end there; today, a friend transferred 6000 via Cred. While Cred shows that the amount has been received in my account, it hasn\u2019t been credited",

I was finally able to log into the app properly today and I see that I need to maintain an NRV of Rs. 10,000 to get rewards (at another point it says I need a salary account). I had been maintaining less balance than that because I was not able to access Jupiter, but I had been using the card for small transactions. So after logging in I found out that I had not been getting rewards at all. I have no idea when this was put into place. Not just that, there is now a rs. 199 charge for debit card, and rewards are limited to salary account. How come I was not sent any kind of notification alerting me of this. I got stupid notifications about Nothing phone offer (on email and whatsapp) but not important notifications like this? So I got a few problems: Why is Jupiter introducing charges without any proper notifications? Why is Jupiter making it impossible to access our account if we don\u2019t have a phone (or have a rooted phone)? In \u201cAccount types\u201d option I see there are two types of accounts - Savings and Salary. But in some places I see the term \u201cPro\u201d account being used which is not mentioned here. How do I get rewards and use free debit card without making this my salary account? What type of account does an NRV of rs. 10,000 upgrade my account to here? How do I close my account if I want to? I really liked Jupiter when I joined and was going to make use of it once it got out of the experimentation phase it seemed to be into an year ago, but all these unwelcome surprises are making me question it",

During this period, earned 810 jewels valued at 162 Rs as rewards, receiving 4% rewards on all three transactions. The statement is pretty neat and clean At present, there are three ways to redeem the jewels: Converting to Cash balance Conversion to Digital Gold and the latest addition: Conversion to Gift Cards However, it\u2019d be far more convenient if users could utilize those jewels to offset the total outstanding amount. This could be similar to OneCard\u2019s option, where one can strike off a particular transaction if there are enough points, or similar to BOB\u2019s method of automatically converting points to cash and adjusting it against the outstanding bill during statement generation",

I am asking this because all these mandates are easy set up and run - especially when the distributor is helping you set it up. But when it comes time to stop, you are in your own and it becomes difficult. I faced this problem with HDFC for my SIP. And kudos to Jupiter for making Zero cost for missing SIP. I understand that it\u2019s relatively easier as the mutual fund distributor and the bank are the same in the case of Jupiter",

You should re-think about this. Feel bad for referring others here. You are just like other banking platforms offering customers many things in the beginning and start withdrawing one by one once reaching a certain customer base. Now I have only one request - Please notify us when you start charging us for not maintaining a min balance. Which means, let us know when you deviate from your existing policies of zero balance account and that are currently free for customers. This would help us to think whether to keep Jupiter or close it. Moreover, your support guys are much interested in closing an open ticket fast without giving proper solution to customers. They might have targets or the fear of losing job when the tickets are not closed on time. Talk to them when you get time. -AK",

The Leaderboard \ud83c\udfc6 It\u2019s a simple leaderboard which shows how long you\u2019ve been supporting your friends on the forum. We also wanted to add a gamified experience and keep a transparent board to showcase our most valued contributors. Leaderboard1080\u00d74170 177 KB How to access the leaderboard? \ud83d\udd0d Home page1080\u00d7938 49.9 KB Head over to the Community forum homepage and tap on the button called \u201cLeaderboard\u201d. Or, you can click on this link here - Jupiter Community It will show you the leaderboard. You can filter the rankings based on date ranges. Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 12.20.07 PM512\u00d7536 19.9 KB How does the leaderboard work? \ud83e\udd14 Points are awarded for engaging with the community, such as visiting, liking, and posting. Your score is updated every few minutes. So go be helpful, active, and supportive, and rise through the ranks! The metric used for scoring is called \u2018rockets\u2019 Making our top contributors feel special \u2764\ufe0f We would like to thank every member who has been supporting Jupiter and the members up till now. Starting from March 1st, 2023, we will be awarding our top 3 contributors on a monthly basis. You will get: A box of Jupiter goodies A chance to speak to 1 team member of your choice. The following team - Product/Business/Marketing/Tech or other similar subdivisions through Zoom/Gmeet. This is your chance to make direct connections! Added to Community Champs (More on this below) As we revamp our leaderboard system in the future, we are planning to add more top contributors: An invitation and tour around the Jupiter office Metal card perhaps? Some important notes: The top 3 contributors from the leaderboard will be selected on a monthly basis. Team members, Admins, and Moderators will not be eligible for now. (Cries in Admin) The top 3 will be selected and announced every 1st of the month. The top 3 will be added to the Community Champions group (Yes! We\u2019re bringing this back) Can you become the chosen one again? The answer is no. Once you\u2019ve been chosen once, you won\u2019t be selected again. Give your friends a chance to keep the mantle This may change as months go by. Community Champions returns Since you get to be a part of the big league, in the coming weeks we are planning to host online Community events where Community champs will have perks that others don\u2019t get. This is a game-changer. More on this later, Stay tuned! A simulation for selection \ud83d\udcbb For example, If the board looks like this: Rank 1 - Admin/Moderator/Team member Rank 2 - Community member Rank 3 - Community member Rank 4 - Community member Or in some cases Rank 1 - Community member Rank 2 - Community member Rank 3 -Admin Moderator/Team member Rank 4 - Community member A secret hack to rise the ranks \ud83d\udc40 There are many ways to get rockets. Likes given (1 ) Likes received (1 ) Posts read (1 ) Posts created (2 ) Time spent on reading hourly (5 ) Daily visits to the Community (10 ) Topics created (25 ) Invite a friend to join the Community (50 ) Note: The rocket scoring system was implemented in January\u201923, so some of you may already have some rockets with you. Try to achieve your rockets the right way. Do not achieve them by spamming the threads. How to invite your friends to our community? Step 1 - Tap on the profile button on the top right and select invites. Profile button for invites718\u00d7674 30.2 KB Step 2 - Click on create the invite button and this pop-up below should appear. Invite form1192\u00d71036 46 KB Enter the Email ID Arrive at a topic - You can enter the URL of any topic you want them to see at first. Example - Break the Ice, Introduce Yourself You can skip the group select option. You can select the expiry date for the link. It should be an easy process, let us know if anyone faces any challenges along the way. Note - Your rockets do not reset. It is a cumulative score that remains with you till the end of time. Would love to hear your thoughts on the leaderboard system in the comments below. More ideas the better. Thank you all once again and have a great weekend friends",

Option to change profile or account holder photo When I opened account in jupiter, they used photo from my aadhar which was very old of me for profile photo. There is no option to change it. someone may thinking is it much important. It will be a great issue if someone has to submit digital passbook for official purposes. 2. Option to rename pot name and add notes I use lot the Pot feature in jupiter. It is a great feature for me. But sometimes when I have to change plan while saving, I have withdraw amount or destroy pot and create anoter pot for it. There isn\u2019t any option to rename the existing pot. Also the option for adding simple note for each pot will be helpful especially when someone has more pots. It will be helpful to add notes about saving plan. 3. Option to pay bills even after due date This month when tried to pay electricity bill in which its due date passed, it says \u201cyou cannot pay this bill anymore because it is past due date\u201d. While other payment apps including paytm, amazon pay, g pay allow users to pay bills even after due date, why not in Jupiter? I hope jupiter team will take good steps and make this features available soon",

Before finalising this new construct, I wanted to share it with you all to hear your views. Here is what I have in mind Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 11.30.50 AM1916\u00d7878 52.6 KB We will be setting milestones for referrals wherein, crossing each milestone makes you eligible to win additional rewards, while the top referrers get a very special reward Note: The current rewards stay the same. We\u2019re just adding in more rewards to the current construct. More info on the app > Refer a friend We are aiming this to go live before the end of January 2023 and should last for 3-4 weeks. This is our first version of the new referral construct. If you folks like it and engage with the initial version, we can roll this out for longer :)) Share what you think about this and let me know what other things you\u2019d like to see in our referral program!

Like many others here, I began following JioCinema during the FIFA World Cup out of curiosity about how a cinema platform would broadcast live matches. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t meet expectations during the inaugural match and was disappointing. However, as the tournament progressed, JioCinema started making improvements. Innovative features like the choice of camera angles caught my attention and made the viewing experience more interesting. This trend continued during the IPL as well, with the introduction of the latest additions like the 360 cam, stump cam, which deserve appreciation. Now, with Hotstar set to stream the upcoming Asia Cup and Cricket World Cup, we can anticipate a significant increase in the number of Hotstar users soon. The reasons why I prefer Hotstar are: Hotstar releases most of the latest Malayalam movies on its platform. I often encounter buffering and connectivity issues when using JioCinema. I am yet to watch \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d . (I\u2019m disappointed to see the shift of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cHouse of Dragon\u201d).

For US stocks, both direct stocks or mutual funds are feasible options to invest in the US markets - but if you\u2019re just starting off in US markets and don\u2019t have strong views on single stocks, you can start with international mutual funds which don\u2019t need any special account or set-up. If you\u2019re looking for specific funds, do search for \u2018international\u2019 equity funds on your Jupiter app - there are many options between sectors and countries even beyond the US. Definitely, if you\u2019re a long term investor. Trying to time the market is sometimes like trying to look into a crystal ball ! In fact, you can take advantage of the market volatility, by setting up your investments through SIPs to get the benefit of investing across market levels. SIPs have a superpower called \u2018rupee cost averaging\u2019 which simply means that you invest a fixed amount every month - when markets fall, you get more units of the same fund. Hope this helps",

        "text": "Hi  Thank you for asking the question. Most commons risks are : Market Risk: Mutual Funds invest in financial markets which go up or down. Most investors look at the returns and invest their money. After some time, when the market goes down, they will see mutual fund invested money going down, panic and take out the money. Hence, they book a loss in profits and confidence in investing. Markets can go up and down due to which the investment horizon is said to be more than 5 years for equity funds. Since, for a longer period of time, the ups and down get balanced out. But if you want to keep the cash for less duration due to your dreams/goals, you can invest in assets like debts which are less volatile. Investing in Mutual Funds with lock-in. When there is a lock like in tax saving, retirement funds users cannot take out their money before the lock-in period expires hence one needs to be careful not to invest their expenses or emergency cash in such funds. And remember if a fund has done well in the previous year, it\u2019s not necessary it will do well in the future too. In stocks major emphasis is given to timing the market since they\u2019re highly volatile. In the day stock might jump 10%-20%+ or go down. But since mutual funds invest in a large collection of stocks out of which some can go down and others can go up, the volatility is lesser. Due to the lesser jump in price on day-to-day basis timing the market isn\u2019t really rewarding as time in the market is. Your money grows every day and you get interested over time in the growing money too",

        "text": "Yes, A little bit late, but hope the members here find this topic useful. World Password Day is an annual event celebrated on the first Thursday of May. The event aims to raise awareness about the importance of using strong and secure passwords to protect online accounts from hackers, and encourages users to take the \u2018Password Pledge\u2019 to assess the strength of their passwords. The event began in 2013 as an effort to educate people about the risks associated with using weak passwords and has grown in significance ever since. It is crucial not only to safeguard personal data but also to protect the data of families and businesses. A brief History: The concept of a \u201cpassword day\u201d was first proposed by security researcher Mark Burnett in his 2005 book Perfect Passwords, which urged people to update their important passwords regularly. Intel Security was inspired by his idea and declared the first Thursday in May as World Password Day in May 2013. Here are some common mistakes people make when creating passwords: Using easily guessable information such as their name, birthdate, or common words. Reusing the same password across multiple accounts. Using short passwords with less than eight characters. Using consecutive letters or numbers (e.g., \u201c1234\u201d or \u201cabcd\u201d). Not including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Using common or predictable patterns (e.g., \u201cpassword\u201d \u201cqwerty\u201d or \u201c12345\u201d). Sharing passwords with others. Writing down passwords in a location that is not secure. Here are some tips for creating a strong and secure password: Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information such as your name, birthdate, or common words. Make sure your password is at least 12 characters long. Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Consider using a passphrase instead of a password, which can be easier to remember and harder to crack. Use a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords. image823\u00d7738 100 KB",

        "text": "baxi I started using groww app recently for direct investing into US stocks. It covers around 2.8K US stocks across sector and includes all of Nasdaq 500 - US Stock Screener - Search and Filter Foreign Stocks - Groww. Pricing for US stocks investing - Brokerage Charges & Pricing | Groww Currently, there are no account opening charges, zero brokerage charges and zero AMC charges. (These may change in future) . I liked the process, of account opening. Fractional investing also allowed on groww app. Groww app is giving 10 USD bonus for first time users. Charges - Though, groww is not charging for US stocks right now, but there are other charges involved - Will try to explain with my experience - (1) INR-USD Exchange rate - I used my ICICI account. (750 + GST (135) + GST-currency conversion 45) \u2192 Total charges 930 ). Not: Other banks may have different set of charges here. (2) Imp. Not - I selected Regular delivery product on ICICI Foreign transfer due to which extra dollars got deducted by ICICI partner bank (I had transferred 180 USD, 6 USD were deducted, hence only 174 were allotted to my groww account) Would suggest to go for Guaranteed delivery. (Extra charges will be there at remittance step only - (roughly around 1200 instead of 930 for ICICI customers). Groww app is also suggesting for guaranteed product. (3) US stock exchange fee - No fee on purchasing stocks, 0.02 USD on selling stocks. Please refer for details Brokerage Charges & Pricing | Groww Few improvements - Transaction history and showing status of all dollars added, removed can be improved. For first few days, I could not see any transaction history. There are few manual steps involved with US stocks account - After transferring funds, we need to email groww app team so they can take care of backend work. I feel as the process get matured, we will see lots of improvements on the platform. But, overall I liked groww app and will continue to invest in few selected US stocks on SIP basis through groww platform only. Note- It is not beneficial to transfer small amounts due to USD-INR exchange fee (approx INR 900 to 1300 ). Better approach would be to get some cash added up, then transfer at one go. Also, staying invested for long term (at-least 4-5 years) would be much more beneficial. Note: US stocks investing only available on groww dekstop app and not available on groww mobile app",

Introducing Edge RuPay Credit Card News from Jupiter Hi, your changed waitlist number will not impact your chance of getting onboarded. We will be rolling out in phases starting next month. Honestly, we didn\u2019t anticipate such a high response for the product. Many users signed up both on website & in-app at the same time, which led to the waitlist mismatch issue. So, we have updated our policy to offer LTF for the first 2 Lakh onboarded users Keep using Jupiter as normal, and maintain a good credit score. Watch out for mor\u2026 And your friend might have joined recently and I suppose that the waiting list number was introduced in the app also similar to the one from the website",

        "text": "I would like to draw everyone\u2019s attention to the following three issues that I discovered while checking the transaction receipt that was sent to me via email: Yesterday, I performed a self-transfer from the Jupiter app to my SBI account (since the account is linked with Jupiter App, the details were already present there). Upon checking the transaction receipt, I noticed that the \u201cPAID TO\u201d and \u201cPAID BY\u201d details are identical and display my Jupiter UPI address on both rows (mobilenumber). can anyone confirm if this is standard practice for self-transfers or if there is an issue that needs to be addressed . (Screenshot/Pic 1). And if there are no issues in this regard, there is another query : I have noticed that my full name appears on the \u201cPaid To\u201d address section, while only my first name is displayed on the \u201cPaid By\u201d address section. The second issue is concerned with the font size of the \u201cPAID BY\u201d address. As you can see, it appears smaller or tiny when compared to the font size of other details. Additionally, when viewing the same receipt on the Gmail app on my mobile device, the address appears to be split into two lines, making it look \u201cbroken.\u201d I am uncertain if this is a problem with my default font size on my mobile or if everyone else sees the same thing. Can anyone please confirm? The device is Oppo Reno 3 Pro. (Screenshot/Pic 2) Lastly, the time stamp on these receipts still shows the year 2022.

I understand that you may be considering not having both a virtual card and a physical card or thinking about deactivating them to avoid the annual maintenance charges and fees. However, I would like to highlight the positive aspects of having debit cards. If you decide to upgrade to a PRO account in the future (I hope you are using a normal saving account at present), you can enjoy rewards by using your debit cards for spending, and this can even help waive certain charges. Another observation I made is that if you have registered for Net banking on the Federal bank website (I hope you haven\u2019t), and you happen to forget your password, you may be required to provide your card details such as the card number and PIN to reset your password. I don\u2019t remember if this information needs to be provided during the net banking registration process",

Confimed with customer support and this is what I have been told: The intereest rate will be adjusted to per day basis. 1% will be deducted from premature breaking of the pot. No matter wheen I break the pot, I will geet the principal+interest(adjusted to per day). Now my question is, why would I make New year bash pot with 61 days lock in period with 4%pa interest(adjusted to per day basis), when I can simply make a 6.25% 365 days super pot, and break it whenever I want and get an assured 5% interest (adjusted to per day rate). Told this to customer support and they agreed with this and told me theyll forward it to their Pots Team. If there is something im missing from the equation, please let me know. If this is indeed a loophole then why didnt nobody thought of this",

Not only have they demonstrated a complete lack of responsiveness and failed to address my inquiries, but they have also left my account blocked for weeks on end. This level of negligence is simply unacceptable. Despite numerous attempts to contact them through various channels, including emails and phone calls, they have chosen to ignore my pleas for assistance. It is beyond frustrating to be met with silence when trying to resolve an issue, especially when it involves accessing my own account. To make matters worse, their delayed actions have caused my account to remain blocked for an unreasonable amount of time. Weeks have passed without any sign of progress or resolution. This not only disrupts my ability to use their services but also highlights their blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and timely support. The lack of answers to my emails and the absence of responses to my calls have further compounded my dissatisfaction. It is as if they have abandoned any responsibility to their customers, leaving us stranded without any form of communication or assistance. In conclusion, I am utterly appalled by the disastrous customer support provided by this company. Their failure to address my inquiries, coupled with the weeks-long blockage of my account, showcases a complete lack of accountability and disregard for their customers. I strongly advise others to steer clear of this company if they value prompt and reliable customer support",

Despite my numerous attempts to seek assistance and resolution, your customer support has consistently failed to address my concerns in a timely and satisfactory manner. Consider this message a final warning. If immediate action is not taken to rectify the situation, I will have no choice but to escalate the matter further. I am prepared to file a consumer case against your company, highlighting the severe negligence and lack of responsiveness exhibited by your customer support team. Furthermore, I will not hesitate to register a formal complaint against your organization on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) online platform. This step will not only shed light on the substandard service you provide but also bring attention to the need for regulatory intervention. I implore you to take this warning seriously and initiate prompt action to resolve my issue. Failure to do so will result in the consequences mentioned above, including the potential damage to your reputation and legal ramifications. It is my sincere hope that we can reach a mutually beneficial resolution without the need for further escalation. However, rest assured that I am fully prepared to pursue every available avenue to ensure my rights as a consumer are upheld.

But now I don\u2019t know what to do with the name which shows up on jupiter, and considering metal card , credit card are going to be offered. I want get my name corrected. What should I do about it and will it affect any of my investments or physical debit card. Is it possible that I do this just before the issuance of metal debit card(if and when it happens) so I directly upgrade to it and don\u2019t have to get another space fire debit card in the mean time.

I will start with the easiest question - FD - we have launched superpots which give you up to 6.25% interest (aka FD that elders talk about :P) If someone steals your phone and need for a branch \u2192 an interesting question to ponder here. You have the Debit Card that you can use to withdraw money from ATMs in India. Branch is something that Neobanks dont have currently so online has to be the only way to provide you any help. In emergency cases, as you mentioned \u2192 alternative ways like availing help from Federal Branch seems like a good idea that we can explore. Can you tell us more about what would \u201cmore reliable offline available bank\u201d mean and where does Jupiter fail in terms of reliability",

I asked customer support the IFSC code and they said we don\u2019t have IFSC, which was like\ud83e\udd23. No matter what bank you are that\u2019s a given, if I would have said the same to my company they would have thrown me out. All in all other times as well I have complained a lot but the customer support is trash, non existent basically. Secondly, the benefits every month it shows you didn\u2019t receive salary credit even though I receive every month and I complaint the customer cares says don\u2019t worry it\u2019s a glitch. A glitch which apparently they couldn\u2019t fix in 10 months since I have enrolled. Earlier they gave benefits for 3 months post last salary credit now it\u2019s one and every month even after salary credit i see the message your account will be downgraded which is pathetic. Third is benefits no credit cards on offer , the health insurance they do offer cannot be continued after salary account expires, the international transaction waiver they do offer is charged then returned, meaning of you do 20 transactions overseas be ready to reconcile and check whether you got the right amount back. How stupid is that, and other benefits are pretty much useless or non existent at best. The idea and community and all is great but execution and overall experience is downright pathetic",

        "text": "Hi everyone! We\u2019re back with another uncomfortable situation around money. Most of us have already faced this. So let\u2019s get to it. Situation for the week You\u2019ve lent some money to your friend. He wanted to buy something urgently and didn\u2019t have the funds at that moment. Since you\u2019re his friend, and trying to help him out, you\u2019ve lent him the money. A few weeks later, your friend seems relaxed and looks like he has the funds to buy things for himself. On a random day, both of you go for lunch and while paying the bill, he hesitates. Nudging you to pay the bill instead. Remember, he still owes you the money you\u2019ve lent. Yet, asks for more by paying his share. It\u2019s a common story: a friend in need, an open hand, and a promise to repay. But what happens when that promise lingers unfulfilled, leaving you caught between financial strain and a strained friendship? The situation is delicate. You value your friend, yet the unpaid loan creates tension. Every reminder feels awkward, every unanswered message stings. Your choices You will need to pick 1 of the below choices: I would recall the money I lent him I would pay the bill now, remind him to pay both later Make him pay now and recall the the money I lent Something else? Comment below! 62 voters Votes are public. Results Ultimately, the decision is yours Remember, clear communication and setting boundaries early on can prevent such situations in the future. Lending money can be an act of friendship, but it\u2019s crucial to treat it like a financial transaction as well, protecting both your wallet and your bond. So, what would you do in this situation? If you\u2019ve faced something similar, please share your experience with others in the thread below! Also, if you\u2019ve missed the last topic, here it is! - Uncomfortable Money situations #1 - Paying at the dinner table",

So, it\u2019s difficult to use as daily basis UPI app. My suggestions: Simplify app UI. Give an option to edit UPI id. Decrease font Size in the app. Home section should be options for Pay to mobile, Transfer, Balance check, History. Invest section should be clutter free. Loan section is good bdw. Upi lite",

I\u2019d like to draw your attention to an already existing UPI feature (new to UPI 2.0?) which both Amazon Pay and BHIM app now feature. It\u2019s an option to set a custom \u2018UPI number\u2019 as your VPA to receive money. It can either be your mobile number or a 8-11 digit number. The best part is that it works cross-platform as it\u2019s a native UPI feature. \u201cNow friends/ contacts using any UPI App can send you money just by entering your phone number (or any other 8-11 digit number that you identify)\u201d. Not sure if it\u2019d be feasible on Jupiter and if Axis bank as the UPI partner would allow it. But, it\u2019s an interesting proposition nevertheless.  PS: Only works on UPI apps that enable this UPI Number feature. Working well between Amazon Pay and BHIM.

If we can come up with a decent MR program that can go toe to toe, with say, HDFC CC or Amex, you\u2019ll see debit card spends shoot up. We just need to make it exciting n rewarding. Add in a flashy metal card, and you are set. This should be easy considering India is a debit + cash heavy market and not so CC reliant as US",

Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Case 1: Some users see zero balance or negative balance in POTS without initiating/withdrawing from POTS (Most of the concerns are raised for this case) Note: A fix for this is being worked on, taking slightly longer than usual. Case 2: Users see a debit transaction without initiating a transaction. (This is a rare case, but we do see users facing this) Note: A fix for this is being worked on, taking slightly longer than usual. If you are facing any of the above cases, we suggest connecting with the support team and raise a ticket. Let\u2019s use this thread to collate all POT-related issues for the above 2 cases. If there\u2019s another use case, please let us know here. Thanks",

        "text": "Hi everyone! The year has just begun and we wanted to ask our Community - How does one carry their physical cards or money? Or, have we upgraded into a virtual one? Here are some options which we\u2019ve all seen. Please add if we missed any! 1. The dad wallet Ah yes, the famous good ol\u2019 dad wallet. It\u2019s big, can carry 10 or even 20+ cards and lots of notes & coins. Sounds good? But there\u2019s a drawback. It\u2019s way too bulky! You might have seen people keeping these in their back pockets. Dad wallet936\u00d7652 42.6 KB 2. Slim, portable but can\u2019t have too many Here comes the slightly fashionable and trendy wallets. You own 4-5 cards at max, a few notes, almost no coins. The materials aren\u2019t just leather anymore. Though they\u2019re classy. You might find them in a blend of nylon or Polycarbonate, polyester. Slightly lighter and durable. 3. Metal heads It\u2019s been here for a while but not many people own these. Personally, I\u2019ve shifted from slim wallets to a metal one. File/Folder style File style1090\u00d71100 59 KB Stack and compress Sliding metal wallets640\u00d7640 14.9 KB Pros: Durable, smooth and feels cold when you hold them. Smaller Cons: High tendency to scratches May bend (depends on the quality/brand) Holds up to 5-6 cards Option 2, cards may be scratched way too easily Another point to add, you can\u2019t carry any notes, coins or business cards. 4. Wallets with a Zip Its a mix of a dad wallet and the slim variants from option 2. These have a Zip, similar to a backpack. Pros: Things won\u2019t fall off that easily (Zips are harder to open - Pro or con?) Average bulge Light weight Cons: You might find it annoying to open it once in a while (Zips take longer, compared to a flip wallet) Zips may get tangled 5. Only digital Ever since the rise of UPI, there are folks who don\u2019t carry a physical card anymore. Let alone, a wallet! There are a lot of apps that can store physical card data and can be used virtually. You can pick your card of choice with a swipe, store business cards, arrange them, and so on. Not sure if these can be accessed without internet. If that\u2019s the case then, that\u2019s a bummer. Google wallet1280\u00d7720 24.8 KB Majority of us keep cards/UPI handles stored on websites & services that we use everyday. Something like an Amazon, Swiggy, Uber. Conclusion We have a lot of options to choose from, and we go with 1 option or maybe have 2 at the same time. So, which preference is for you? Share your experience with us in the thread below",

Think of gold mines as an additional benefit to the original construct. Why gold? We want people to start a healthy habit of investing in the early stages and Digi Gold was one of our first investment products. So we would like to start with this. Referral campaign Since we are still experimenting with our referral program, we wanted to hear the Community's thoughts on the structure and rewards. We also wanted to know if a reward like Digital Gold would excite you. If not, let us know in the comments below what kind of rewards you would like to have I can\u2019t wait to hear from you",

I suspect this may be the same number I tried to use when initially creating my account. Unfortunately, at that time, I encountered difficulties with Aadhar verification, preventing the successful creation of the account. Since then, I have successfully created an account using a different phone number. Previously, I had initiated the account opening process using a phone number that I could not complete due to Aadhar verification issues. Consequently, that previous account remains incomplete and half-baked. Now, as I am trying to switch my currently opened account\u2019s phone number to that previous phone number which is linked with my bank accounts and Aadhaar card, the app indicates that my desired number is already associated with the incomplete KYC account which I did not open yet and now not even allowing me to proceed with the further with that account also. Could you kindly guide me on how to delete or resolve the half-baked account associated with my previous phone number? Your prompt assistance in addressing this matter would be highly appreciated. I look forward to your guidance",

From DICGC (Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation subsidiary of Reserve Bank of India) every licensed bank has an insurance guarantee of your money up to 5 Lakh only in case of bankruptcy of the licensed bank. Btw there is a 0% chance of bankruptcy for our large banks. Imagine these 0 probability conditions: If one (licensed) bank account has 50 lacs and it goes bankrupt then you can get up to 5 lacs by DICGC. But if you have 10 (licensed) bank accounts you have 6 lacs each. And 3 banks went bankrupt (18 Lakhs wiped out). Then you can get up to 15 Lakh (5 lacs each). How do neo-banks earn? These banks do not have high sources of revenue or income such as lending or investing (bcs money is deposited in partner banks). Savings from revenue: Because they do not have physical branches their expenditure is less on staff members and maintenance and they save a chunk of revenue and spend less. Transactions charges (and penalties.) Commission charges from the partnered bank for acquiring a large chunk of the customer base (via giving an easy account opening process.) Extra commission by providing more worthy customers such as those who can maintain 10,000 NRV/MAB (30 days average of deposited money should be equal to or greater than 10000) and who can do FDs. To acquire such customers, they spent on pro benefits for customers. Sponsors Commission from Merchants (amazon, Flipkart etc.) Debit card issuance, and transaction charges. Hope you get it.

(Home page shown when opening app during biometric unlock ) Also one of the oldest bugs where it was consuming a lot of mobile data on iOS seems to be fixed ( not sure if it was bug in the iOS or the app) but seems to be fixed long back (I am noticing that now). ( High internet data consumption of app ) The help/info/FAQ icons are unified ( in almost all sections) and some other elements like search bar are more consistent throughout the UI. ( Seemingly minor things in the jupiter app design that really gets on my nerves as a Ui designer ) Kudos to the development team for the progress .

This solves the problem of not knowing how much money the user had/has before/after a transaction. It will be easy to track the money flow, if the change in balance or change in the base amount is displayed after every transaction. I always have to scroll down and make a particular transaction as a base point and compare it to my current bal. to see how much is the net expenditure after that base transaction. The idea of tags can be implemented, but the idea which I have suggested in my original argument, this feature is more fundamental and more like a must-have feture which already exists in many bank applications like YONO (by SBI), and ICICI Mobile, etc. Please find a screenshot attached below, to better understand my idea. Screenshot_20230313_100052_YONO SBI1080\u00d72400 153 KB You can see that after each transaction, the balance is displayed on the bottom right of each transaction tile.

Also do consider integrating bullet/BNPL in Jupiter itself. Provide an option to customize the UPI ID so that our phone numbers can\u2019t be exposed. I generally just keep my name as UPI id. You can limit the number of custom UPI id on just 1. That would be fine and would take care of fraud possibilities as some apps have pointed out recently.

Now if I make a transaction of Rs.15,000/-, the insufficient balance of Rs.8,000/- which is not in Savings account will be withdrawn from the linked FD.

Anyone faced the similar issue,pls reply with snap ,if you have taken",

Or your morning auto ride? Or the outfit you ordered. While you thought of them as plain, simple payments, did you ever think they could also help build your financial future? Well, with our newest feature, they can! 31080\u00d71080 86.1 KB Now automatically invest \u20b910 or more with every payment you make! So every time you spend, you can invest \u20b910 or more in a Mutual Fund. It\u2019s fully automatic and works in the background, while you go about spending as usual. For example, if you spend \u20b9500 on Swiggy, a minimum of \u20b910 goes to a Mutual fund of your choice. And you can set a monthly upper limit to be invested. That means if you want, you can invest only up to \u20b91500 in a month. Here\u2019s more Q. What can a \u20b910 investment even do? Even these seemingly small amounts add up over time, thanks to the power of compounding. Imagine the magic of having your daily chai contribute to your dream vacation or retirement fund! Q. Is it completely automatic? Yes, it is completely automatic. Now you don\u2019t need to remember deadlines or manually transfer funds. This feature takes care of the investing, so you can focus on enjoying life. Q. Will Jupiter pick a fund for me? You can choose the Mutual Funds of your choice! What does it look like?

While a fund is recommended, you have the option to choose your mutual fund to invest. The identification of the transactions eligible to be considered for investments is very quick and the cash register sound that one gets is very satisfying. If you have multiple transactions becoming eligible for investment in a day, multiple folios will be created. For 15 transactions in process, 4 have been processed and 3 folios have been allocated. From this point on I am hoping the remaining 11 transactions will be get allocated in either of these folios",

Soon, our members will have access to chat casually with other members and have private conversations with others in a seamless way. Currently, to converse with others, we have: Ability to post comments under a thread Ability to make threads Ability to chat privately (DM) Coming soon: Ability to join a channel separately and chat like WhatsApp/Slack/Discord, etc Here\u2019s what it would look like: Icon placement: Top right Chat overview Overview786\u00d71050 48.6 KB Private chat/channel view window786\u00d71042 31.7 KB While the team was testing this, we noticed it can be enabled for a group/certain set of users. We wanted to know who to enable this feature for since we\u2019ll be using it in the end. Community Champs - Special privilege Only for Active members - level (3&4) Opt in basis via Group All users? Would be spammy. 28 voters Results Note: We can limit the notifications to mention only. So you won\u2019t get spammed if you\u2019re not online. We can create multiple channels but the access for all the channels will be based on who can see them (Based on the poll above) You can join multiple channels and leave them at any point of time. However, once you leave, you cannot rejoin them. This can be fixed by asking any admin/mods. We can add any member to the channels. Does it affect leaderboard points? We\u2019re not sure yet. Though, we\u2019d like your help in order to test this theory. We think chatting in channels might not contribute to the leaderboard. Overall, the chat system is pretty clean and fun. It could replace our direct message system since it\u2019s like a thousand clicks away How we could use this? For direct chat (1on1) Casual chats that aren\u2019t relevant to the thread topic (Avoids spam) Let us know your thoughts on this. Based on everyone\u2019s decision, we\u2019ll make it happen. Have a great weekend, friends. Have fun",

Instead of directly adding members to a custom group, would it be possible to have an \u201capprove\u201d invitation or \u201cjoin\u201d option for members, similar to WhatsApp? This would allow for better control over who is added to the group and prevent unwanted members from joining without approval",

If you have the new UI, what\u2019s your experience like compared to the older one? let us know in the comments below You can vote for which UI you like better. I prefer the card stack UI I prefer the tabs to be on top separately 69 voters Votes are public. Results Last week, we rolled it out to 50% of the users and it will reach most of you soon 2.

Looks like such an arrangement is not possible to pay the Edge Rupay credit card. Accepting NEFT payments will be the easiest for me to automate, but I am with other modes of automation, too. Axis Bank, for example, uses E-NACH mandates to auto debit payments. That\u2019s a good way, too. OneCard also supports automatically debiting my bank account on the due date. Please provide one such option for paying the Edge Rupay credit card too",

The QR code scanning feature is readily available on the homepage and can also be accessed easily by holding or pressing the Jupiter App icon from the App menu on Android (just like we do for uninstalling an app). These widgets simply redirect you back to the app, and I prefer to access features directly from within the app itself (this is just my personal opinion). Sunny Kothari: QR code and Account details sharing widget for android phones. Regarding shortcuts, You can find more here: Using quick app shortcuts the real way Feedback & Ideas Friends, Did you know? You can make an app icon for app shortcuts? If you long press the Jupiter app icon on your phone, you get a few app shortcuts. [Screenshot_20230222-143402] It doesn\u2019t end here. You can long press the options shown above to get an app icon. [Screenshot_20230222-143425] If you click on this scan and pay icon, it would open the scanner instantly (after biometrics). I\u2019ve seen this only on Android devices. It\u2019s quick and handy. Saves a lot of time. Has anyone used th\u2026 Also, previous discussions regarding widgets can be read here, Jupiter Widgets for IOS and Android Jupiter app With the upcoming release of ios 16 there are ton of new features being added to the software.

My suggestion: Money can be loaded onto a SIP Pot. This money is separate from the one in your bank balance. And the user doesn\u2019t need to maintain a balance at the date of SIP payment.(the money will be deducted from the pot directly) So, no hassle of SIP date skipping. And more beneficial to the user. Let me know your opinion too. It can be complicated for some, but according to me there are some who will admire this feature",

There were some discussions internally about having one but, we\u2019re still thinking about it Introducing-41080\u00d71080 109 KB We wanted to hear the community\u2019s thoughts about these as well. Do you own or used one before? If you haven\u2019t seen any Debit card skins, here are some examples: 1569\u00d7569 24.4 KB Screenshot 2022-11-22 at 3.08.51 PM852\u00d7566 32 KB They come in 2 types. Covers the whole card, like shown above or, Covers everything else except the numbers and info, for example below.

We also think keeping the OG spacefire colour is needed since that\u2019s what we started with and that\u2019s how our users remember us. In this case, would it be better to keep translucent skin instead? We wanted to keep this for special users. Community folks maybe? For example, gift box wraps. Some come in a faded translucent type with few patterns. But you can still see what\u2019s underneath. Also, here\u2019s a similar concept shared by  NFC enabled stickers for phones Features Jupiter should have this feature(Not sure if it can be implemented ) . A sticker that can be pasted anywhere like phones / watches, which has nfc support . My phone doesnt support tap and pay. If this was an option I would certainly buy the sticker. To me it makes more sense than carrying a debit card [image] Share your thoughts below",

If you don\u2019t want to unfreeze my account then that\u2019s fine but at least tell me what is the exact reason for blocking the account. If you think I am a terrorist or a robber, then take legal action, I will answer them myself, but is it right to ask to open an account in another bank without giving any reason or solution like this? You have taken all my personal details then opened my account and again I have proved myself after that you have successfully done my video KYC verified then what can be suspicious in my onboarding process. To my knowledge, there is no such transaction which I have found suspicious. If so, please tell me what is the definite reason. You are not keeping any transparency with me about my account then where will I get transparency about it",

When it comes to the addition of APCPDCL, Jupiter may not have the capability to take action. Its functionality relies on the Bharat Bill Payment System. I have checked both Postpe and Flipkart Pay Later, which utilize Bharat Bill Pay, but I couldn\u2019t locate the APCPDCL option there either. Perhaps it will be added in the near future",

There\u2019s also too many steps for doing a simple tasks. They (withdraw, view transaction) can be shown upfront itself instead of nesting it with 2 or 3 steps. For every step it\u2019s taking 3 to 5 secs. Im using galaxy note lite. It\u2019s not the top notch. But it should be optimised for even the lesser configured phones too right.

If someone is reading this post from Jupiter Edge team request you to kindly verify all the application or reject all applications if you can\u2019t verify.

Interested? Let us know how much you would like to pay for the metal card and what you expect from it.

Afterwards it is your headache if the rest of lending goes to drain. Collection charges? You pay them. The stats they show are \u201cstats\u201d. Based on a large number of loans. Faircent as of today shows \u201cVery high risk\u201d having the following numbers - 28% return. Net return 18% after loss of 10%. What they do not make easy to understand is that to get these numbers you need to have a large amount invested. From statistics point of view this makes perfect sense. But as an individual your experience would vary wildly if your amount is not large enough. Quarterly Advance tax payment liability. I had to start paying advance taxes because there is no TDS. If I knew this I would have probably never started P2P Lending simply because of the quarterly hassle. Pay taxes at slab rates You cannot square off your losses against your interest or any collection charges. So pay taxes on your interest and lose your money too. There is a disbursal time period in which you don\u2019t get any returns. I tried disbursing some amount and it took them 1 month to disburse it. What do you get for that time period? Nothing. They will not show you XIRR but instead show an absolute return. their reports have rounding errors. This is shameful (maybe illegal, not sure) that an NBFC has reports with rounding errors. I told faircent about these rounding issues in 2018 but those have not been fixed yet in 2021. Let that sink in. A NBFC dealing with money has rounding errors in their reports which was reported to them nearly 3 years ago but has not been fixed yet. Not large rounding errors but few rupees in every loan will add up. It is not that these were not written anywhere. Most of it is written. But good luck figuring this all out by reading the various blog posts that they write before investing",

All things can do by PNB one app . *Minimum FD amount: 13 k *Limit 80 % of selected FD *FD must be auto Renewal *Minimum tenure 1 year *Virtual card 10 minutes in PNB one app *Managed by pnb genie app *No joining and annual maintenance fees *Online FD can breakable online anytime after final closing the cc , branch created FD is only closed via branch. *There is two variant Visa and rupay *If u choose rupay, u can also linked any upi app , and usable any merchant. Pro tips; you can go through for 666 days FD, which gives you highest returns (7.5 % p/a) Once more: you can link this card with Bhim ( govt) app , and paying to any merchant amount 1k , which can gives you 100 ( maximum 10% upto 100) cashback per month till December 23",

Perhaps it\u2019s a technical glitch that the platform is currently experiencing. Thanks",

The HDFC-Swiggy credit card offers 10% cashback on Swiggy food orders, Instamart orders, Genie services, and DineOut bookings, but users have complained that they have not been receiving the full cashback amount. The cashback is also capped at \u20b91,500 per month. Other features of the card include 5% cashback on e-commerce spends and 1% cashback on everything else, capped at \u20b91,500 and \u20b9500 per month, respectively. Users also get a 3-month membership of Swiggy One for \u20b91,299 as a welcome bonus. Some of the problems that users have faced with the card include: The cashback is credited as Swiggy Money, which can only be redeemed on the Swiggy app. Spends on food orders or DineOut are randomly categorized under \u2018Bundl Technologies\u2019, Swiggy\u2019s parent company, and users receive only 1% cashback on these orders, instead of the promised 10%. The total cashback for expenses originating on Swiggy is capped at \u20b91,500 per month. The Swiggy app does not allow users to raise any dispute related to credit card billing. HDFC\u2019s helpline gets disconnected four out of the five times when contacted. Many users have complained about the difficulties in getting a card, despite being eligible for one. Some users have also been unable to link their card to the Swiggy app. Overall, the HDFC-Swiggy credit card is a good option for those who use Swiggy regularly, but it is important to be aware of the limitations of the card, such as the cashback cap and the fact that the cashback is credited as Swiggy Money",

Analysts say that the move by banks to essentially devalue cards also signals that they want to tighten their belts. \u201cThey have built a customer base probably with offers that were too good, but now there is some pressure on banks\u2019 profitability,\u201d said Karhtik Srinivasan, group head, financial sector ratings, at ICRA. \u201cOne way to look at it is banks are consolidating their customer base, but there has been no real impact on either card issuances or spends so far",

You can pay before generate the bill if exceed the 30% limit. Don\u2019t use ATM ( use instead Rent Pay to cash out or use other available trick) Enquiry for Loan/Credit Card : Applying for Any(or multiple) Credit Card, Loan , BNPL will be visible in Credit Score and might down your credit score. You can\u2019t remove this enquiry, so think twice before applying for new one. Account Type : Mixed Type account is good , it means you can hold 1 ( or more) Credit Card, Loan / BuyNow PayLater. Note: Secure Loan ( like - Home Loan) & Secure Credit Card ( Like- against Fixed Deposit) will be positive points . So if your credit score is low take one Secure Credit Card ( PaisaBazaar Credit card, OneCard, IDFC , Kotak Bank, SBI etc staring from \u20b92K FD) . History : as Old account as good consideration for credit score. Don\u2019t close your old Credit Card until it\u2019s fee is in the sky . Repayment never avoid and pay before due date . Also Do not use minimum pay , always pay full EMI or bill. Closure Accounts : Close unused Loan Account , also close PayLater if you\u2019ve multiple ( 1-2 is ok , more than 3 Loan won\u2019t be good impact ) If account is closed still seeing in Reports? Email them and tell issue and ask for NOC too. Note : if you are using PayLater/Loan from Long time and paying on time, slowly it will be normal over the time & later in years it will no longer have negative impact",

Rewards: I don\u2019t think I have utilised any rewards other than free coffee in Bangalore and donating some points for masks and other social angles. These days all the rewards are now in copay model that nothing is free but everything requires me to pay money and some cred points as well.

Instead, having categories like Deposit/FD, Lending, Investment Withdrawal, Mutal Funds/Equity, etc. is helpful The ability to create custom categories. The tags feature is there but having custom categories could actuallly help with tracking spending accurately. Also, the tags feature is not available for connected banks. The recent payments/payment categorization could appear in the Payments tab instead of in the Money tab. It seems logical to tag, categorize and manage payments from where I actually make payments. The money tab could host features like tracking all my investments (FDs, MFs, EQ, US stocks, P2P Lending, Bonds, EPF, PPF, NPS; tracking my liabilities.

If you\u2019re still wondering what this is, here\u2019s the introduction for the series - Introducing Money situations series! News from Jupiter Hello Community! Hope everyone is doing well Just wanted to talk about a thought around how we interact with money in our daily lives. [Banner] Money makes the world go round, and let\u2019s be honest, it can also cause stress and awkward silence Whether you\u2019re struggling to make ends meet, navigating student loans, or planning for retirement, money is a deeply personal topic that often feels off-limits in conversation. But here\u2019s the thing: money doesn\u2019t have to\u2026 So let\u2019s start. Situation for the week Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s been a tiring day at work and you and your friends planned to have a dinner party. It continues for hours and seems to be a lot of fun! Folks ordered a lot of food & drinks and no one was keeping track of the bill. After some time, you call for the waiter and the bill arrives The bill amounts to Rs. 7000 and 4 friends are involved, including yourself. Things to consider - All you had was 1 salad and maybe a coke. Not much. It\u2019s time to pay up but you are thinking about splitting the bill equally or step up and tell your friends about how much you had to pay. Or maybe, another alternative to this? Your choices You will need to pick 1 of the below choices: I will split the bill equally I will only pay for my share Ask someone to pay for my share & pay later Something else? Comment below! 73 voters Votes are public. Results What would you do in this situation? There is no right answer. Let us know in the comments below if you\u2019ve faced this situation or a similar one. How did you deal with it",

A whole Investment section for SIPs and stocks. Tax related features. A service to track cheque, cancel cheque, request chequebook like debit card management services. Auto pay using UPI. Auto sweep to jupiter FD Pot facility . Desirable DP in Jupiter (I don\u2019t want to see my aadhar pic anymore). Edit or remove payee details. Round off expense money near 10, 50, 100 and save the change in selected pot or FD pot. A collateral Jupiter Credit card 95% limit against FD in jupiter pot (interest rate of FD pot should be 6.5% - 8%) . FD should be redeemable at anytime without any maturity at Rs 0 charges providing temporarily block the card on breaking the FD pot. Credit card with emi conversion (sometimes no cost) and interest free credit for some days. Dark mode. Edit Email and mobile number. Pay to UPI Number (no boundation to use multiple apps) Last and final for now, a dedication and customer satisfaction with profitable business I will edit later if i have to add or remove somthing. I know it\u2019s too much long list but there are plenty of time because I am not going to time bound the team. I know that team is also many of features already as I saw on Trello",

        "text": "Absolutely! Here\u2019s a breakdown of how Jupiter could improve its UPI app experience, focusing on dedicated offers and cashback, and how to frame these suggestions as requests to Jupiter: I. Enhancing Offers and Cashback within Jupiter UPI Dedicated \u201cOffers & Rewards\u201d Section: Instead of burying offers within transaction history or relying on push notifications, create a prominent \u201cOffers & Rewards\u201d section within the UPI app. This section should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and clearly categorize offers. Personalized Offers: Leverage Jupiter\u2019s data analysis to provide personalized offers based on user transaction patterns. For example: Frequent grocery shoppers get cashback on supermarket UPI transactions. Users who often pay for food delivery get discounts on partner restaurants. Utilize user location data to provide local merchant offers. Tiered Cashback/Rewards System: Implement a tiered system where users earn more rewards based on their UPI transaction volume or frequency. This could include: Base cashback on all UPI transactions. Bonus cashback for hitting monthly transaction goals. Exclusive offers for high-volume users. Partner Merchant Offers: Forge partnerships with popular online and offline merchants to offer exclusive UPI cashback and discounts. Promote these partnerships prominently within the \u201cOffers & Rewards\u201d section. Gamification: Introduce gamified elements like: \u201cStreaks\u201d for consecutive daily UPI transactions. \u201cChallenges\u201d to earn bonus rewards. \u201cSpin the wheel\u201d or scratch card options for random rewards. Clear and Transparent Cashback Tracking: Provide a clear and real-time view of earned cashback and rewards within the app. Ensure easy redemption of cashback to the user\u2019s Jupiter account. Inform the user of expiring offer and cashback. II. Framing Requests to Jupiter Here\u2019s how you can phrase your suggestions as constructive requests to Jupiter: Subject: Enhancing Jupiter UPI with a Dedicated Offers & Rewards Section Body: \u201cDear Jupiter Team, I\u2019m a loyal Jupiter user and I appreciate the convenience of your UPI feature. To further enhance the user experience, I\u2019d like to suggest the implementation of a dedicated \u2018Offers & Rewards\u2019 section within the Jupiter UPI app.\u201d \u201cThis section could feature personalized offers, partner merchant discounts, and a tiered cashback system, making it more engaging for users.\u201d \u201cSpecifically, I would like to request that you consider the following:\u201d \u201cCreating a visually appealing \u2018Offers & Rewards\u2019 tab.\u201d \u201cImplementing personalized offers based on transaction history and location.\u201d \u201cDeveloping a tiered cashback system to incentivize frequent UPI usage.\u201d \u201cPartnering with popular merchants to provide exclusive UPI offers.\u201d \u201cAdding gamification elements to make rewards more engaging.\u201d \u201cProviding clear and transparent cashback tracking and redemption.\u201d \u201cAdding a system that notifies users of expiring offers and cashback.\u201d \u201cI believe these improvements would significantly increase user engagement and make Jupiter UPI an even more valuable tool.

Our intelligent system uses many different ways to determine your credit limit. Timely repayment and Bullet usage are important factors. However, the process is completely automatic so we will not be able to give you details on any increase in your limit and when it can happen. If there is an increase, we will let you know. kshitij_purwar: does using Bullet improve your credit score like a credit card does? As of now it doesn\u2019t - we plan to have this down the road. kshitij_purwar: what are the future plans for Bullet look like? We plan to add a lot of exciting features for you to avail the convenience of Bullet - Bill Payments, Shopping, Rewards & deeper merchant integrations. Stay tuned",

I had got my phone stolen on Dec 13 and along with it, I lost my sim which was registered under my sister\u2019s name and she is abroad right now. So I couldn\u2019t get a duplicate of it. I went to the nearest federal Bank and updated my phone number over there and I had filled the email address registered on the form. They said I\u2019d get access to Jupiter in 24hrs. Now that I am trying to login to my Jupiter, it shows a message that \u201cthe email is address is registered to another number (old number)\u201d. I reached out to your customer support via call and chat number of times which I found to be a complete waste of time and energy. I had no issue with updating phone number at Kotak Mahindra which is my salary account. Why do you guys have no way of verifying an existing user other than phone number? I even got my Pan card and aadhar updated while you guys still have trouble sorting my issue out. Not even a ticket numbe was raised even after reaching out so many times. How can I trust someone like you when I have my savings pot stuck inside it? Is there no way for your system to authenticate an existing customer other than using phone number?

You may put a condition of payment by Jupiter credit/debit card or account to just get some better margin; But do NOT make a another costly, complex & frill full option to just show that you are offering something.

The insurance plan, like the one mentioned above (Rs. 499) - that\u2019s the actual cost for the plan. Subject to change though. On another note, we did some user research and found that people want immediate value out of their insurance plan, esp. when the premium is paid upfront. Also, insurance is delayed gratification and long-term game",

Considering insurace products involve delayed gratification, when the overall cost for the product gets subsidised at the cost of letting go of a subscription plan or a free health checkup, the likelihood of someone investing in it, would see an uptick. Again, that\u2019s my point of view. I look forward to the insurance product offerings being released on the app",

There is a big name in payment app space who offers wallet protection in less than 499; which could be a competitor for your offers. Instead of giving screen OTT related freebies; offer D Mart kind of super mart coupons which add real saving to the core needs of the majority of your users.

This is live on the app on the Payments Page for folks who had enrolled for  This is available from the app version 1.6.18 onwards. Make sure you update the app to the latest version. Community-spotlight-10834\u00d7834 137 KB Here is a sneak peak into what you can expect as per the current scope of the Search Bar 1. Know your transactions Check your spends on specific merchants such as Swiggy, or categories such as travel. 2. Make a payment using UPI, Bank transfer to friends, family, others. This is the first version of the search bar. Like how Ironman created Jarvis for the first time. The search feature runs on conversational AI and it becomes more robust with more data points and your feedback. We are continuously monitoring the product to make this feature more accurate While you test it out, would love to know your honest thoughts about these. Did you like the new experience? What did you like/dislike? Did you face any issues while testing the product for the above 3 pointers listed in the scope of the product? How else can we improve the experience? Let us know your thoughts! We have a lot of new features in the pipeline that you would be able to see on the Search Bar. This product is still in a beta phase. We are in the process of incorporating this feature for other products as well ! Keep an eye out! Happy testing",

Few things I found about The search function doesn\u2019t show transactions for a particular person. When I search using a name Jupiter is showing transactions not related to that person. I also tried adding that person through the add payee feature and then searched but still showed irrelevant transactions. In the payments tab, the recently paid section shows people who I have sent money to. However, when I click on the person, I am taken to make a payment screen. I cannot see the history of transactions for that person. This is not the case with Gpay or Fi. Please look into it. Feels like a crucial feature.

Just an area for you guys to improve if you care. Have a feature in the app where the user can mark or \u201cinform\u201d the app that he\u2019s gonna do an international transaction, maybe via OTP or some extra verification in advance. And THEN DON\u2019T DENY THE TRANSACTION. Generally, if international transactions are off by default, logging in to the app and turning them on should be enough. But it wasn\u2019t in my case as the transaction failed. I had no time to waste so Jupiter won\u2019t be my choice of debit card for forex ever again unless the team does something proactive about fixing this",

        "text": "Hi guys! Quick intro - I lead the debit card business at Jupiter and we are currently racking your brains to figure how to pack more goodness into the card! One of the things we are considering is: INSURANCE! Yes most cards in the market come with some kind of insurance but we want to make sure that we add something that is actually useful to the user. Now, if I were to ask folks which insurance they would like - the most common answer would be health insurance or mobile insurance! But honestly, these are QUITE expensive to be given as a free add-on To give you an idea, a decent health cover can cost more than 10-15k annually, depending on your age and type of coverage. But we still want to give you something that is actually beneficial to you and adds value to your financial and personal life! So how about hospitalization coverage against accidents? If you ever have any kind of accident and need hospitalisation due to that, your cost of medical treatment would be covered upto the sum insured. So you can have the peace of mind to not worry about sudden expenses and cash crunch in an emergency! The only caveat for availing this insurance is that you should have used your debit card at least once in the last 30 days. That\u2019s all! Do hit one of the options below to let us know if you\u2019d like this feature on your card and drop any other ideas/ thoughts in comments! Accidental Hospitalization Cover sounds useful to me I don\u2019t need an Accidental Hospitalization Cover I don\u2019t really know/ care 80 voters Results",

        "text": "The availability of Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) schemes has made purchasing high-value items much more convenient for customers. EMI schemes allow customers to pay for the product over an extended period of time, rather than paying the full amount upfront. However, this convenience can also lead to impulsive buying behavior, where customers make purchases without fully considering the financial impact of the EMI payments. Participants in the thread share their personal experiences with EMI schemes and impulsive buying behaviour and provide tips for avoiding impulsive purchases. The discussion highlights the need for customers to be mindful of their spending habits and to make informed decisions when considering EMI schemes. What is EMI? To attract more customers and increase sales, merchant outlets and credit card companies in India offer Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) payment schemes. This is particularly helpful for customers who may not have the immediate funds to make a purchase but can afford to pay in instalments over a period of time. EMI is a popular payment option for electronic appliances, mobiles, laptops, and other gadgets, where customers can buy the product and start using it immediately while paying for it in smaller instalments spread over a longer duration. EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is a fixed amount of money that a borrower pays to a lender on a monthly basis, usually for a loan or credit card payment. The EMI includes both the principal amount and the interest charged on the loan. EMI is commonly used for payments related to loans for personal expenses, education, vehicles, homes, and other assets. What is Impulsive Buying? Impulsive buying is the act of making a purchase without prior planning or consideration, often based on emotions, desires, or immediate needs rather than careful evaluation of the product or service. Impulsive buyers tend to make quick purchasing decisions without fully considering the long-term consequences or benefits of the purchase. This behavior is often driven by factors such as advertisements, peer pressure, discounts, and emotions like excitement or stress. Impulsive buying can lead to overspending, financial stress, and buyer\u2019s remorse, particularly when the purchased item turns out to be unnecessary or of low quality. So here are some of the questions for the community friends: Have you ever made a purchase using an EMI scheme? If so, What was the first product you purchased on EMI? Which EMI plan do you prefer the most (3 months, 6 months etc etc\u202624 months)? Have you ever faced any difficulties after purchasing for friends or family members using EMI? (like missed payments) In your opinion, does the availability of EMI options lead to impulsive buying behaviour?

Don\u2019t plan for the payment after you\u2019ve made that purchase",

Have you ever faced any difficulties after purchasing for friends or family members using EMI?

ZestMoney provided me with a credit limit of around 35,000 rupees when I initially registered with them (however, this limit was wiped out abruptly after the COVID pandemic, and now it\u2019s zero).

This Month I had talked to OneCard customer care & he told First Metal Card is free but Replacement cost will be \u20b93K ( As a company you may cost \u20b95K+ for it) and also will option for Plastic Card to avoid huge change as they have to pay too for Metal Card . IMG_20220619_0948401078\u00d71697 204 KB  OneCard Referral Program is \u20b9250 but some time they give \u20b91000 or \u20b92000 , depends on that days campaign offer",

        "text": "Here are some updates : Today, we finally used the Edge CSB Rupay Card at a Hypermarket situated in our nearby town. The total bill amounted to 987 Rs, and as always, the QR Scanner on Jupiter\u2019s app gave a swift and flawless experience, completing the transaction at lightning speed. I want to express my appreciation for the UI design team, particularly for introducing the 'limit spent percentage\u2019 feature. This is the first time I\u2019ve come across such functionality, as it is absent in BOB\u2019s credit card app or website. Unlike those platforms, which only display the remaining or available credit limit, this feature provides valuable insight into the percentage of the credit limit that has been used, so that anyone can spend without worrying about credit utilization calculations regarding CIBIL and all. After the successful completion of the first UPI transaction, the welcome voucher offer was unlocked all of a sudden. Here too, I really appreciate the Jupiter team. If I remember correctly, I got the promised Snapdeal voucher after 45 or 60 days, and that too after tweeting and tagging the BOB team. vouchers1631\u00d7929 134 KB Loved those choices too \u2026We opted for the Flipkart Voucher, and we received the voucher code and PIN instantly. Adding these to our Flipkart wallet balance was a smooth process without any issues. Regarding Jewels : Got 198 jewels for the transaction of 987 Rs. 198 Jewels = 198/5 = 39.6 Rs. Which means 4% of the transaction value. Not bad at all image405\u00d7574 82.2 KB When we attempted to make another payment at a different outlet, we received this message.

That\u2019s all. Firstly, you didn\u2019t even mentioned the actual query in the original post. You just mentioned \u201cI had a simple question about jewel redemption\u201d. Only after 21 days, you are mentioning your actual issue, i.e., \u201cMy question was very simple: can I redeem jewels to any bank account, that is, other than Jupiter bank account?\u201d Secondly : You said you wrote the mail. It was unclear to which email you wrote since they have two separate mail ids support.money for general enquires and edge-csb-support.money for Rupay credit card related issues. My intention was simply to assist you in reaching the appropriate team and what I understand is that at present, you can redeem jewels (Converted to cash) only to Jupiter account. Tagging",

The important point is whether the Jupiter management knows about the silo culture in the company, and whether they care about it. Given that they haven\u2019t even bothered replying, and instead they\u2019re freeloading on community members to answer such queries, I guess it shows how much they care. As for the 21 days to respond, fixing Jupiter\u2019s internal problems isn\u2019t really a priority for me. Some days back, they had sent an email about some new gimmick called 3-in-1 rewards, so I logged in to give them feedback on it, and that\u2019s when I saw some notifications on this post",

I don\u2019t know how they came on conclusion that Fintech banks can disrupt financial stability, for me it\u2019s opposite of what I believe in. The Fintechs are still regulated by RBI rules and regulations at their core. Disruption by Fintechs are good for people and economy as more people have reasons to believe in banks due to better services at low costs",

Change is necessary, and these big banks need to up their game or die by the wayside. From my POV, I see the banking cartel egging the RBI to stifle neobanks and their promise of innovation. Scoring over a million users in a matter of months isn\u2019t easy. But Jupiter did it. I\u2019m sure the biggies see us as a credible threat. Hopefully we\u2019ll get a clearer picture in the near future. Maybe sensible laws n regulations",

If you\u2019ve already been using other platforms/apps for recharges, what is the one thing you liked on those platforms that you\u2019d like to see on Jupiter? Anything else on your mind  Here are my observations - The section is placed prominently in the bill payment section which is good. Very happy that the provider names are getting detected with accuracy. Tested it with 5 different numbers & every time the provider was correct. While there is some difference in the placement of recharge packs under different categories, I was able to find the recharge packs that I usually recharge for. The payment experience was very seamless. Received a confirmation message from Jio instantly. I typically use Cred, Gpay with Axis Ace Card, Amazon with Amazon Pay ICICI card for cashback. This might be a bit tricky for Jupiter. I see MTNL has been included in the provider category. Are there plans to include BSNL as well as that has a bulk of users? May not be the target audience. Just stating this from a merchant availability perspective",

Easy product discovery: You will be able to easily discover the product offering on the Investment home page and quickly navigate through MF Explore, Gold, and FD. Total current value across investment products: You will be able to view the total current value on the investment Home page. The total current value will be the summation of the current values of Mutual Funds, Gold, and FD. Critical updates and actions: You will be able to quickly see the updates and action information on the Investment Home page. Why the change? Monotonous: Investment home page was monotonous - it seemed like a mutual fund explore page rather than an Investment Home page. Product discovery: The discovery of FD and Digital gold was limited to spotlight cards. How to get started? Just download app version >= 2.0.15 or update the app to the latest version. Best reviews get \ud83c\udf81 We would like to reward Jupiter lab testers for their hard work. We like to shape the product with our Community folks. The Investments team will pick 5 value-adding reviews in the comment section below. The 5 reviewers will be rewarded with 200j each. Note: You will need to be part of the Jupiter Labs group in the Community. Your review should be in the comments below. Test duration Users registered for Jupiter Labs on or before March 28th, 2023, will be eligible to test.

The idea of providing an consolidated view definately helps. The navigation buttons are working as expected. The numbers terms of absolute returns and % returns also show the correct value. Never had a doubt, still checked it to be sure . Like the idea of providing updates on mutual fund transactions that are in process. If possible, an update on the upcoming SIPs especially about the ones started via Jupiter would help from a UX perspective as it will reduce the time taken to reach the mutual fund section of the app to look for those details. When user chooses to view the investment value and then switches to a different screen & returns to the investment screen, the value is not hidden. It is still visible. If it is possible, I\u2019d recommend that value to be hidden again. Just helps from peeping Tom perspective. On clicking the mutual fund option, user lands on the explore mutual funds screen. The settings cog on the top right hand corner takes the user to the investment account details section and the same settings cog in the dashboard screen of mutual funds takes the user to my account screen. Ideally even from here, the user should be taken to the investment account details screen. Using the back arrow on the app and the native back button of the phone, does stump the app as it takes longer for the app to go back",

I don\u2019t want to have the amount invested from External funds be displayed here. There should be an option to disable it which you currently don\u2019t have. I have asked for this long back, and I was informed that it will be addressed. But, nothing is done for that till now. I uploaded CAS which has all my investments just to see what analysis you are giving. I was not informed that the investment amount will be displayed everytime in the app. This is distracting for my experience with the app. Please fix this.  Feedback taken. We are reviewing the current tracking mutual fund feature and will share an update in a few days",

So whenever there is a mention for his handle  and the term \u201cFavourite food\u201d was mentioned, it would read the word and transfer the balance from main account to Pots. We could set the term from the app. But just imagine the misuse for this. Anyone could probably create a Twitter account and keep mentioning the handle non stop with the term. The balance will go poof But it\u2019s in the pots anyway. A big no for this one But! Love the IFTTT integration though. Our Pots feature should be able to do this in the future",

IFTTT lets the onus of forward linking to the user. pelase ignore the lame examples i shared earlier. a real example would be like this 1/ every time i take a walk to office instead of a car, automatically Rs 100 (fare of car) gets deposited in a POT - as aa rainy day savings. 2/ every time a user gets added to my channel, a pots (for donation) gets credited Rs 10, to donate to teh the NGO who\u2019s story is being led by my channel to begin with 3/ every time (a good deed is triggered by IFTTT), a (credit) is made in a (pots) 4/ heck, I can open an account for my kids in jupitor and penalize them everytime a swear word is heard in the house by alexa/google etc and transfer it in a swear pot that would be example of use cases that can drive up acceptance of pots, in daily lives, of the next generation Long time no siege",

Plus to the extent of purchasing something and the app automatically putting money aside would be the only thing I could agree with anything more than that is just too much. What if I my phone is switched off? How will Jupiter still track it. Plus why should Jupiter track it I don\u2019t get it. Its too much of a privacy concern for me on how Jupiter might use that data in other ways. These things can be done manually by just a few clicks Jupiter has made it easy. I want to save for fuel? Open a fuel pot. But maybe it would be good about lets say my pot is at 90% we can set it so Jupiter automatically tries to fill it to 100% but still keep a ratio of money in the main account in case we need it",

The solution for this is try to make the authentication factor better till than don\u2019t give biometric option. Because it\u2019s not user friendly. Most important one when I do scan and pay option and I give access to all the permission it get exited from the app. So this should not happen while doing payment.

Also, regarding the Jupiter Bank statement generation issue, I have a correction. Actually Jupiter let you generate monthly bank statements but there is no option to generate yearly or half yearly bank statement generation. Also Jupiter does not have the option of bank statement generation for a particular time period. In my case, I was able to generate monthly statement from Jupiter but I wanted the bank statement of the past 180 days (6 months) which is not possible in Jupiter app as of now",

Should be linked with FD or Debt Funds or provide us choice to even select Equity fund as target pot. There are FDs in the market with 7.5% interest and with instant withdrawal facility, IND Money. Fi can do all this being with same banking partner, Federal Bank. Jupiter is on complete loot mode with POTs Fi is much better in this with their Savings, MF rules based investment concept. The only plus with Jupiter is UI and Customer support The day, Fi improves their customer service\u2026 Jupiter will have very tough time keeping customers. And I dont see Jupiter coming even closer to FI in rule based saving , investaments in next 2 years. They are on a different path with their product development.

It\u2019s frustrating and time-consuming to deal with merchants on my own. The bank should at least send an email to the merchant regarding my issue and have customer support guide me through these situations. In the past, when I was a victim of online fraud , the bank didn\u2019t help me much . They just told me to file a FIR and fill out a form in person , but didn\u2019t mention the option of registering a complaint on the cyber department\u2019s website , informing the sender and receiver banks and platforms , or calling the cyber fraud helpline . It would also be great if banks had a blog on these topics to educate their customers and make them feel safe and secure when making purchases or sending money . I want the refund and chargeback process to be simple and have the bank\u2019s team guide me through it. I\u2019d even choose a bank that provides strong support over one that offers more rewards and cashbacks . This is a big problem in the banking industry today and I believe neo banks have the potential to solve it and be game-changers . However, neo banks are still dependent on their partner banks for handling transaction disputes , so there\u2019s still a wait for that. Nonetheless, neo banks should not neglect this issue or they won\u2019t be able to differentiate themselves from traditional banks . The big players like IDFC , AU , and Paytm Payments Bank are still in the game",

So, what are the security protocols and processes you should look for, every time you transact online? How to defend against online breaches in online payment security? Are there any best ways to improve online security? Payment Security\ud83d\udd10 It is essential to create general awareness among people about online security and fraud. Precaution is always better than cure. An aware customer and equally trained employee can be considered as one of the key points to fraud minimization. In addition to the awareness within employees, a business owner should also be familiar with government schemes and regulations to prevent fraud. Two-factor authentication\u2705 2FA gives a more sophisticated level of protection. This authorization is mainly used while entering an account. 2FA adds an extra layer of security that can be used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are.

Great reminder for those under the old tax regime\u2014you can save up to \u20b946,800 if you\u2019re in the 30% slab. Make sure to invest timely each year",

        "text": "Hai  Few months back, Jupiter launched a waitlist option to individuals interested in obtaining a salary account without the need for company-related information. The process simply required an automatic monthly transfer of 25,000 from their personal account, giving them to access the advantages of a salary account. However, this feature was temporarily suspended due to certain issues, and currently, it is not available. Moreover, I think a company email ID is must for the verification process when setting up a salary account. If I am not wrong, some users upgraded their account exploiting some loopholes and such account either got suspended or downgraded after some audit. So I hope someone from the salary team can give you clarification on this. Also, you can refer these two threads for more details.

Hence today I went to Federal Bank, Andheri East to change my communication address since Jupiter is using Federal Banking services for the saving bank. I was told my Federal Bank that address change is not available for Jupiter account holders, it can only be done for Federal Saving Accounts, we need to contact Jupiter for that, I said Jupiter told me there is no such option with them, I was told by the Federal Bank employee that sorry it is not possible to change the address. I have searched this community for similar topics and have found countless topics opened for the same issue, I don\u2019t understand how a basic feature like address change not available in the app, you have time for features like Pots and Pans but a basic feature like Address Change is not possible for you ? I will unfortunately not be able to use your world class bank app since this simple feature not being available becomes a deterrent, tomorrow if there is some financial issue operating your app, and you ask for identification documents, you will deny solution stating the address do not match with the documents provided and with the address available with your bank. I will be left in a problematic situation. I would like to also suggest other customers not to invest/save your hard earned money in this app, you never know what sort of problems you could face if a simple address change feature is not available, your money could get stuck for good",
